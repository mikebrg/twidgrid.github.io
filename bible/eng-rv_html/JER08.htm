But, behold, the false pen of the scribes hath wrought falsely.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what manner of wisdom is in them?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall possess them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I will utterly consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and <span class='add'>the things that </span>I have given them shall pass away from them.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>We looked for peace, but no good came; <span class='add'>and </span>for a time of healing, and behold dismay!   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembleth; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and those that dwell therein.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For, behold, I will send serpents, basilisks, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! my heart is faint within me.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her King in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt: I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?   </div><ul class='tnav'>
