  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains; and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for <span class='add'>your </span>pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD’S flock is taken captive.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your headtires are come down, even the crown of your glory.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>What wilt thou say, when he shall set <span class='add'>thy </span>friends over thee as head, seeing thou thyself hast instructed them against thee? shall not sorrows take hold of thee, as of a woman in travail?   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore are these things come upon me? for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels suffer violence.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away, by the wind of the wilderness.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore will I also discover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I have seen thine abominations, even thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills in the field. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?   </div><ul class='tnav'>
