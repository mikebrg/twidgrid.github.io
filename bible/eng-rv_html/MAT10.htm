If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more <span class='add'>shall they call </span>them of his household!   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light: and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And be not afraid of them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father:   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Fear not therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father which is in heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law:   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>and a man’s foes <span class='add'>shall be </span>they of his own household.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
