Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, <span class='add'>are they </span>unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD; unto us is this land given for a possession:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
