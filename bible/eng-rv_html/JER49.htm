<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 49</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Of the children of Ammon. Thus saith the LORD: Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth Malcam possess Gad, and his people dwell in the cities thereof?   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess them that did possess him, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Who shall come unto me?   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather up him that wandereth.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Of Edom. Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For thus saith the LORD: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I have heard tidings from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For, behold, I have made thee small among the nations, and despised among men.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>As for thy terribleness, the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Edom shall become an astonishment: every one that passeth by it shall he astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of Jordan against the strong habitation: but I will suddenly make him run away from her; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over her: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, <span class='add'>even </span>the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The earth trembleth at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Of Damascus. Hamath is ashamed, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote: Thus saith the LORD: Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the children of the east.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels: and they shall cry unto them, Terror on every side.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Flee ye, wander far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Arise, get you up unto a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD; which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners <span class='add'>of their hair </span>polled; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals, a desolation for ever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam; the chief of their might.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
