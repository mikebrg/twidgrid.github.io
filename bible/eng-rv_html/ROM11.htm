<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel,   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars: and I am left alone, and they seek my life.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>What then? That which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their back alway.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation <span class='add'>is come </span>unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy <span class='add'>them that are </span>my flesh, and may save some of them.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For if the casting away of them <span class='add'>is </span>the reconciling of the world, what <span class='add'>shall </span>the receiving <span class='add'>of them be</span>, but life from the dead?   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which are the natural <span class='add'>branches</span>, be grafted into their own olive tree?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And this is my covenant unto them, When I shall take away their sins.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shewn to you they also may now obtain mercy.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him <span class='add'>be </span>the glory for ever. Amen.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
