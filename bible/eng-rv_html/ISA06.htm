Then I said, Here am I; send me.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and the LORD have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And if there be yet a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
