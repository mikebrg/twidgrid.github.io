Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also smitten the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, <span class='add'>and reigned </span>twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and dealt wickedly above all that were before him.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof with the loss of his youngest son Segub; according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
