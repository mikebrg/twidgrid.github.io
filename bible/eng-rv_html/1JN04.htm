By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <span class='add'>to be </span>the propitiation for our sins.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>hereby know we that we abide in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son <span class='add'>to be </span>the Saviour of the world.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>We love, because he first loved us.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
