Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as <span class='add'>corn </span>is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
