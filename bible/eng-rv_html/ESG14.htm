I abhor it as a menstruous rag, and I wear it not when I am private by myself.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And thine handmaid hath not eaten at Aman’s table, neither have I honoured the king’s feast, nor drunk the wine of the drink offerings.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Neither had thine handmaid any joy since the day that I was brought hither to this present, but in thee, O Lord, thou God of Abraham.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>O God, that art mighty above all, hear the voice of the forlorn, and deliver us out of the hands of the mischievous, and deliver me out of my fear.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
