<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead;   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he healed.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they did so, and made them all sit down.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it came to pass, as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others <span class='add'>say</span>, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But he charged them, and commanded <span class='add'>them </span>to tell this to no man;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and <span class='add'>the glory </span>of the Father, and of the holy angels.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But I tell you of a truth, There be some of them that stand here, which shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment <span class='add'>became </span>white <span class='add'>and </span>dazzling.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elijah;   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Master, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child:   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And as he was yet a coming, the devil dashed him down, and tare <span class='add'>him </span>grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples,   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it: and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>But Jesus said unto him, Forbid <span class='add'>him </span>not: for he that is not against you is for you.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And they did not receive him, because his face was <span class='add'>as though he were </span>going to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And when his disciples James and John saw <span class='add'>this</span>, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?   <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>But he turned, and rebuked them.   <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And they went to another village.   <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.   <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven <span class='add'>have </span>nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.   <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.   <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.   <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.   <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
