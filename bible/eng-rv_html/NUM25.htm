So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house among the Simeonites.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Vex the Midianites, and smite them:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>for they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
