  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession; <span class='add'>whereof one went </span>on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>and certain of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them:   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall;   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And they kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, and <span class='add'>so did </span>the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they sanctified for the Levites; and the Levites sanctified for the sons of Aaron.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
