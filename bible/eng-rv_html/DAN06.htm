The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to rescue him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. <span class='add'>Now </span>the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice: the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, or ever they came at the bottom of the den.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end:   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth; who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
