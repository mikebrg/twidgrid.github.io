and they became little wings and small.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But her heads were at rest: the head in the midst was greater than the other heads, yet rested it with them.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Moreover I beheld, and, lo, the eagle flew with her wings, to reign over the earth, and over them that dwell therein.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I beheld how that all things under heaven were subject unto her, and no man spake against her, no, not one creature upon earth.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I beheld, and, lo, the eagle rose upon her talons, and uttered her voice to her wings, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Watch not all at once: sleep every one in his own place, and watch by course:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>but let the heads be preserved for the last.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I beheld, and, lo, the voice went not out of her heads, but from the midst of her body.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I numbered <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">The Syriac has her little wings, and, &amp;c. </span></a> her wings that were over against the other, and, behold, there were eight of them.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I beheld, and, lo, on the right side there arose one wing, and reigned over all the earth;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and so it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and it appeared not, so that the place thereof appeared no more: and the next following rose up, and reigned, and it bare rule a great time;
