Daring, selfwilled, they tremble not to rail at dignities:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>whereas angels, though greater in might and power, bring not a railing judgment against them before the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing; <span class='add'>men </span>that count it pleasure to revel in the day-time, spots and blemishes, revelling in their love-feasts while they feast with you;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; children of cursing;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the <span class='add'>son </span>of Beor, who loved the hire of wrong-doing;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a dumb ass spake with man’s voice and stayed the madness of the prophet.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For, uttering great swelling <span class='add'>words </span>of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in error;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>It has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
