And Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Where now are your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard, and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
