And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full <span class='add'>of years</span>; and was gathered to his people.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: he abode in the presence of all his brethren.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated even from thy bowels: And the one people shall be stronger than the other people; And the elder shall serve the younger.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the first came forth red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: and Rebekah loved Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint:   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red <span class='add'>pottage</span>; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall the birthright do to me?   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: so Esau despised his birthright.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
