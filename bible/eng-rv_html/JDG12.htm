If he said, Nay;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth; for he could not frame to pronounce it right; then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of Jordan: and there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in <span class='add'>one of </span>the cities of Gilead.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons.
