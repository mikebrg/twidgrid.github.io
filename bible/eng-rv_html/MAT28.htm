Come, see the place where the Lord lay.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, <span class='add'>and continueth </span>until this day.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when they saw him, they worshipped <span class='add'>him</span>: but some doubted.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
