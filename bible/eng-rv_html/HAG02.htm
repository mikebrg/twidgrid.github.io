And the priests answered and said, No.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then answered Haggai and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Through all that time, when one came to an heap of twenty <span class='add'>measures</span>, there were but ten; when one came to the winefat for to draw out fifty vessels, there were but twenty.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; yet ye <span class='add'>turned </span>not to me, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Consider, I pray you, from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth <span class='add'>month</span>, since the day that the foundation of the LORD’S temple was laid, consider it.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree hath not brought forth; from this day will I bless <span class='add'>you</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the word of the LORD came the second time unto Haggai in the four and twentieth <span class='add'>day </span>of the month, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
