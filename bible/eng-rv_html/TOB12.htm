<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Tobit called his son Tobias, and said unto him, See, my child, that the man which went with thee have his wages, and thou must give him more.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he said unto him, Father, it is no harm to me to give him the half of those things which I have brought:   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>for he hath led me for thee in safety, and he cured my wife, and brought my money, and likewise cured thee.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the old man said, It is due unto him.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he called the angel, and said unto him, Take the half of all that ye have brought.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then he called them both privily, and said unto them,  </div><div class='p'>Bless God, and give him thanks, and magnify him, and give him thanks in the sight of all that live, for the things which he hath done with you. It is good to bless God and exalt his name, shewing forth with honour the works of God; and be not slack to give him thanks.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God. Do good, and evil shall not find you.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Good is prayer with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>alms doth deliver from death, and it shall purge away all sin. They that do alms and righteousness shall be filled with life;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>but they that sin are enemies to their own life.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Surely I will keep close nothing from you. I have said, It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And now, when thou didst pray, and Sarah thy daughter in law, I did bring the memorial of your prayer before the Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee likewise.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when thou didst not delay to rise up, and leave thy dinner, that thou mightest go and cover the dead, thy good deed was not hid from me: but I was with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And now God did send me to heal thee and Sarah thy daughter in law.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and go in before the glory of the Holy One.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces; for they were afraid.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Be not afraid, ye shall have peace; but bless God for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For not of any favour of mine, but by the will of your God I came; wherefore bless him for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All these days did I appear unto you; and I did neither eat nor drink, but ye saw a vision.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And now give God thanks: because I ascend to him that sent me: and write in a book all the things which have been done.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they rose up, and saw him no more.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared unto them.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
