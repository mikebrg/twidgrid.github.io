For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And every one that hath this hope <span class='add'>set </span>on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness: and sin is lawlessness.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span><span class='add'>My </span>little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span><span class='add'>My </span>little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him,   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>whereinsoever our heart condemn us; because God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
