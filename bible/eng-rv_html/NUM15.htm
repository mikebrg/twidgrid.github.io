as ye do, so he shall do.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth <span class='add'>with you</span>, a statute for ever throughout your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering throughout your generations.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with the meal offering thereof, and the drink offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin offering.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their error:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And if one person sin unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat of the first year for a sin offering.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth unwittingly, before the LORD, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is homeborn among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But the soul that doeth aught with an high hand, whether he be homeborn or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment; that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue:   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
