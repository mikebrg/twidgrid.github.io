And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they gathered them together in heaps: and the land stank.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: and there were lice upon man, and upon beast.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will put a division between my people and thy people: by tomorrow shall this sign be.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the LORD did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow: only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
