Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, The LORD is my God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
