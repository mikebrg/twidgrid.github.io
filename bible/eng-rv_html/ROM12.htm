Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honour preferring one another;   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honourable in the sight of all men.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
