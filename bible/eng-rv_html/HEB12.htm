For if they escaped not, when they refused him that warned <span class='add'>them </span>on earth, much more <span class='add'>shall not </span>we <span class='add'>escape</span>, who turn away from him that <span class='add'>warneth </span>from heaven:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>word</span>, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe:   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>for our God is a consuming fire.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
