<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The neighbours therefore, and they which saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am <span class='add'>he</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him <span class='add'>to be </span>Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He therefore answered, Whether he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and <span class='add'>yet </span>he opened mine eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they which see not may see; and that they which see may become blind.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Those of the Pharisees which were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
