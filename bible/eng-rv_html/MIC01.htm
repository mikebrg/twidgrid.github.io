What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, <span class='add'>and </span>as the plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate: for of the hire of an harlot hath she gathered them, and unto the hire of an harlot shall they return.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For this will I wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a mourning like the ostriches.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For her wounds are incurable: for it is come even unto Judah; it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: at Beth-le-Aphrah have I rolled myself in the dust.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Pass ye away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good: because evil is come down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee: the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Make thee bald, and poll thee for the children of thy delight: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
