And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold an earthquake, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I beheld, and lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So I prophesied as he commanded me; and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and <span class='add'>for </span>all the house of Israel his companions:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thine hand.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, <span class='add'>even </span>with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them: it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the nations shall know that I am the LORD that sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
