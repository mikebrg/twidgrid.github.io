And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with the LORD all his days.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he brought into the house of the LORD the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span><span class='add'>There is </span>a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then king Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him; according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin; because of his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the hook of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, <span class='add'>and reigned </span>twenty and four years.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
