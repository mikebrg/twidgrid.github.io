My reins are consumed within me.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>If ye say, How we will persecute him! seeing that the root of the matter is found in me;   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath <span class='add'>bringeth </span>the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
