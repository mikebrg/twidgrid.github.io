And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Hezekiah gave <span class='add'>him </span>all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>At that time did Hezekiah cut off <span class='add'>the gold from </span>the doors of the temple of the LORD, and <span class='add'>from </span>the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army unto Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou sayest, but they are but vain words, <span class='add'>There is </span>counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not with us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? <span class='add'>hath he not sent me </span>to the men which sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spake, saying, Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah, with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
