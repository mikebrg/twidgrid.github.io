And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he departed without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
