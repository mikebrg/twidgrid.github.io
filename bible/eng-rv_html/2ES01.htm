but they have provoked me unto wrath, and have despised my counsels.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Shake thou then the hair of thy head, and cast all evils upon them, for they have not been obedient unto my law, but it is a rebellious people.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>How long shall I forbear them, unto whom I have done so much good?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Many kings have I overthrown for their sakes; Pharoah with his servants and all his host have I smitten down.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>All the nations have I destroyed before them, and in the east I have scattered the people of two provinces, even of Tyre and Sidon, and have slain all their adversaries.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Speak thou therefore unto them, saying,   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, of a truth I brought you through the sea, and where there was no path I made for you highways; I gave you Moses for a leader, and Aaron for a priest.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I gave you light in a pillar of fire, and great wonders have I done among you; yet have ye forgotten me, saith the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord Almighty, The quails were for a token to you; I gave you a camp for your safeguard, nevertheless ye murmured there:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and ye triumphed not in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but ever to this day do ye yet murmur.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Where are the benefits that I have done for you? when ye were hungry and thirsty in the wilderness, did ye not cry unto me,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>saying, Why hast thou brought us into this wilderness to kill us? it had been better for us to have served the Egyptians, than to die in this wilderness.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I had pity upon your mournings, and gave you manna for food; ye did eat angels’ bread.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When ye were thirsty, did I not cleave the rock, and waters flowed out to your fill? for the heat I covered you with the leaves of the trees.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I divided among you fruitful lands; I cast out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines, before you: what shall I yet do more for you? saith the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord Almighty, When ye were in the wilderness, at the bitter river, being athirst, and blaspheming my name,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I gave you not fire for your blasphemies, but cast a tree in the water, and made the river sweet.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>What shall I do unto thee, O Jacob? thou, Judah, wouldest not obey me: I will turn me to other nations, and unto them will I give my name, that they may keep my statutes.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Seeing ye have forsaken me, I also will forsake you; when ye ask me to be merciful unto you, I will have no mercy upon you.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Whensoever ye shall call upon me, I will not hear you: for ye have defiled your hands with blood, and your feet are swift to commit manslaughter.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Ye have not as it were forsaken me, but your own selves, saith the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Have I not prayed you as a father his sons, as a mother her daughters, and a nurse her young babes,   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>that ye would be my people, and I should be your God; that ye would be my children, and I should be your father?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I gathered you together, as a hen <span class='add'>gathereth </span> her chickens under her wings: but now, what shall I do unto you? I will cast you out from my presence.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>When ye offer oblations unto me, I will turn my face from you: for your solemn feast days, your new moons, and your circumcisions of the flesh, have I rejected.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>I sent unto you my servants the prophets, whom ye have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will require <span class='add'>of your hands, </span> saith the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Your house is desolate, I will cast you out as the wind doth stubble.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And your children shall not be fruitful; for they have neglected my commandment <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Or, together with you </span></a> unto you, and done that which is evil before me.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Your houses will I give to a people that shall come; which not having heard of me yet believe me; they to whom I have shewed no signs shall do that which I have commanded.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>They have seen no prophets, yet they shall call their former estate to remembrance.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>I take to witness the grace of the people that shall come, whose little ones rejoice with gladness: and though they see me not with bodily eyes, yet in spirit they shall believe the thing that I say.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And now, O father, behold with glory; and see the people that come from the east:   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>unto whom I will give for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Oseas, Amos, and Micheas, Joel, Abdias, and Jonas,   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Nahum, and Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggaeus, Zachary, and Malachy, which is called also the angel of the Lord.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
