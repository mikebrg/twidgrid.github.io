for your destruction is at hand.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A sword is sent upon you, and who is he that may turn it back?   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>A fire is sent upon you, and who is he that may quench it?   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Evils are sent upon you, and who is he that may drive them away?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>May one drive away a hungry lion in the wood? or may one quench the fire in stubble, when it hath once begun to burn?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>May one turn again the arrow that is shot of a strong archer?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Lord God sendeth the evils, and who shall drive them away?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>A fire shall go forth from his wrath, and who is he that may quench it?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He shall cast lightning, and who shall not fear? he shall thunder, and who shall not tremble?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Lord shall threaten, and who shall not be utterly broken in pieces at his presence?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The earth quaketh, and the foundations thereof; the sea ariseth up with waves from the deep, and the waves of it shall be troubled, and the fishes thereof also, at the presence of the Lord, and before the glory of his power:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>for strong is his right hand that bendeth the bow, his arrows that he shooteth are sharp, and shall not miss, when they begin to be shot into the ends of the world.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold, the evils are sent forth, and shall not return again, until they come upon the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The fire is kindled, and shall not be put out, till it consume the foundations of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Like as an arrow which is shot of a mighty archer returneth not backward, even so the evils that are sent forth upon earth shall not return again.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Woe is me! woe is me! who will deliver me in those days?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The beginning of sorrows, and <span class='add'>there shall be </span> great mournings;
