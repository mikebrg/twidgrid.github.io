And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, My wife; lest, <span class='add'>said he</span>, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah: because she was fair to look upon.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household: and the Philistines envied him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the herdmen of Gerar strove with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they contended with him.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they digged another well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they said, We saw plainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he called it Shibah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>and they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
