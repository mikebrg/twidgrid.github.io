<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 78</div><div class='d'>Maschil of Asaph. </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Give ear, O my people, to my law; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>That the generation to come might know <span class='add'>them</span>, even the children which should be born; who should arise and tell <span class='add'>them </span>to their children:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they forgat his doings, and his wondrous works that he had shewed them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He clave rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Yet went they on still to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold, he smote the rock, that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; can he give bread also? will he provide flesh for his people?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore the LORD heard, and was wroth: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them of the corn of heaven.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Man did eat the bread of the mighty: he sent them meat to the full.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He caused the east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he guided the south wind.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, and winged fowl as the sand of the seas:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So they did eat, and were well filled; and he gave them that they lusted after.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They were not estranged from their lust, their meat was yet in their mouths,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>When the anger of God went up against them, and slew of the fattest of them, and smote down the young men of Israel.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For all this they sinned still, and believed not in his wondrous works.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in terror.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>When he slew them, then they inquired after him: and they returned and sought God early.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But he, being full of compassion, forgave <span class='add'>their </span>iniquity, and destroyed <span class='add'>them </span>not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And they turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>How he set his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, that they could not drink.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>He gave over their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a band of angels of evil.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>He made a path for his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And he led them safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>He drove out the nations also before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and kept not his testimonies;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>When God heard <span class='add'>this</span>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the adversary’s hand.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Fire devoured their young men; and their maidens had no marriage-song.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And he smote his adversaries backward: he put them to a perpetual reproach.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath established for ever.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>From following the ewes that give suck he brought him, to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
