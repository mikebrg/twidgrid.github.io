But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not at all <span class='add'>his </span>will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let all that ye do be done in love.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboureth.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema.
