<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 69</div><div class='d'>For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim. <span class='add'>A Psalm </span>of David. </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let not them that wait on thee be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of hosts: let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonour through me, O God of Israel.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When I wept, <span class='add'>and chastened </span>my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a proverb unto them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They that sit in the gate talk of me; and <span class='add'>I am </span>the song of the drunkards.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy, answer me in the truth of thy salvation.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up; and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Answer me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: according to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in distress; answer me speedily.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: ransom me because of mine enemies.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let their table before them become a snare; and when they are in peace, <span class='add'>let it become </span>a trap.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Let their habitation be desolate; let none dwell in their tents.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And it shall please the LORD better than an ox, <span class='add'>or </span>a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The meek have seen it, and are glad: ye that seek after God, let your heart live.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For the LORD heareth the needy, and despiseth not his prisoners.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; and they shall abide there, and have it in possession.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The seed also of his servants shall inherit it; and they that love his name shall dwell therein.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
