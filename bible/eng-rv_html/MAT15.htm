And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This people honoureth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But in vain do they worship me, Teaching <span class='add'>as their </span>doctrines the precepts of men.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>these are the things which defile the man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at his feet; and he healed them:   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint in the way.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place, as to fill so great a multitude?   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
