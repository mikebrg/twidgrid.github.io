As an eagle <span class='add'>he cometh </span>against the house of the LORD: because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God: yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing corn; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For they are gone up to Assyria, <span class='add'>like </span>a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be minished by reason of the burden of the king of princes.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars have been unto him to sin.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Though I write for him my law in ten thousand <span class='add'>precepts</span>, they are counted as a strange thing.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
