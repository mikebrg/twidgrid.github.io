They shall feed in the ways, and on all bare heights shall be their pasture.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Lo, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have compassion upon his afflicted.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Zion said, Jehovah hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, these may forget, yet will not I forget thee.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thy children make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I l live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament, and gird thyself with them, like a bride.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For, as for thy waste and thy desolate places and thy land that hath been destroyed, surely now shalt thou be too strait for the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the nations, and set up my ensign to the peoples: and they shall bring thy sons in their bosom, and thy daughters shall he carried upon their shoulders.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and they that wait for me shall not be ashamed.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy saviour, and thy redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
