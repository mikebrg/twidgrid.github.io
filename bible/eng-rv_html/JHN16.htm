And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was with you.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>of sin, because they believe not on me;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more;   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, <span class='add'>these </span>shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare <span class='add'>it </span>unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare <span class='add'>it </span>unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span><span class='add'>Some </span>of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye shall see me?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be fulfilled.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but shall tell you plainly of the Father.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now know we that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and <span class='add'>yet </span>I am not alone, because the Father is with me.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
