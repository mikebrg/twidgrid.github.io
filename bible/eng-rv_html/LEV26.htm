  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall chase ten thousand: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and will establish my covenant with you.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I also will do this unto you; I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>then I will walk contrary unto you in fury; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest; even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that because they have walked contrary unto me,   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them; and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they rejected my judgments, and their soul abhorred my statutes.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God:   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
