<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valour.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel;   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Ought ye not to know that the LORD, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And there were gathered unto him vain men, sons of Belial, which strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Have ye not driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the peoples of <span class='add'>other </span>lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of <span class='add'>them that are </span>no gods.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and <span class='add'>we have </span>priests ministering unto the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense: the shewbread also <span class='add'>set they </span>in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD, the God of their fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD smote him, and he died.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
