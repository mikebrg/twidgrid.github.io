Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day <span class='add'>alike</span>. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For to this end Christ died, and lived <span class='add'>again</span>, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, And every tongue shall confess to God.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let not then your good be evil spoken of:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor <span class='add'>to do anything </span>whereby thy brother stumbleth.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because <span class='add'>he eateth </span>not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
