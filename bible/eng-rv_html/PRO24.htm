To have respect of persons in judgment is not good.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; peoples shall curse him, nations shall abhor him:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But to them that rebuke <span class='add'>him </span>shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He kisseth the lips that giveth a right answer.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Prepare thy work without, and make it ready for thee in the field; and afterwards build thine house.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me; I will render to the man according to his work.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, the face thereof was covered with nettles, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then I beheld, and considered well: I saw, and received instruction.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span><span class='add'>Yet </span>a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>So shall thy poverty come as a robber; and thy want as an armed man.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
