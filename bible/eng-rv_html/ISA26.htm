Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust: for thy dew is <span class='add'>as </span>the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
