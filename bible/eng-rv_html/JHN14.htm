Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me;   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
