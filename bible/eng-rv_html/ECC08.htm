A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I <span class='add'>counsel thee</span>, Keep the king’s command, and that in regard of the oath of God.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Because the king’s word <span class='add'>hath </span>power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man’s heart discerneth time and judgment:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>for to every purpose there is a time and judgment; because the misery of man is great upon him:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in <span class='add'>that </span>war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: <span class='add'>there is </span>a time wherein one man hath power over another to his hurt.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And withal I saw the wicked buried, and they came <span class='add'>to the grave</span>; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and prolong his <span class='add'>days</span>, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, <span class='add'>which are </span>as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be righteous men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him in his labour <span class='add'>all </span>the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
