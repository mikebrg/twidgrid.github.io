  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>thou shalt not be afraid of them: thou shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>the great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves, perish from before thee.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and a terrible.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the LORD thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the LORD thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and shall discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and thou shalt not bring an abomination into thine house, and become a devoted thing like unto it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
