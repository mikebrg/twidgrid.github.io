I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yea, I trod them in mine anger, and trampled them in my fury; and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For the day of vengeance was in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I trod down the peoples in mine anger, and made them drunk in my fury, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, <span class='add'>and </span>the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us; and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For he said, Surely, they are my people, children that will not deal falsely: so he was their saviour.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But they rebelled, and grieved his holy spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, <span class='add'>and </span>himself fought against them.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, <span class='add'>and </span>his people, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? where is he that put his holy spirit in the midst of them?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>that caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? that divided the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>that led them through the depths, as an horse in the wilderness, that they stumbled not?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>As the cattle that go down into the valley, the spirit of the LORD caused them to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy mighty acts? the yearning of thy bowels and thy compassions are restrained toward me.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For thou art our father, though Abraham knoweth us not, and Israel doth not acknowledge us: thou, O LORD, art our father; our redeemer from everlasting is thy name.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>O LORD, why dost thou make us to err from thy ways, and hardenest our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thy holy people possessed <span class='add'>it </span>but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>We are become as they over whom thou never barest rule; as they that were not called by thy name.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
