And he went in in my sight.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the glory of the LORD mounted up from the cherub, <span class='add'>and stood </span>over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD’S glory.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling <span class='add'>wheels</span>, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took <span class='add'>thereof</span>, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their wings.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been within a wheel.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When they went, they went upon their four sides: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, <span class='add'>even </span>the wheels that they four had.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling <span class='add'>wheels</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them: and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the glory of the LORD went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’S house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
