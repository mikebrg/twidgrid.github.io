 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 
 <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 
 <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.

 <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top <span class='add'>may reach </span>unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_11_4	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 11:4	"><p><p>

 <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.  
 <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the LORD said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. 
 <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

 <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.  <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_11_9	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 11:9	"><p><p>
