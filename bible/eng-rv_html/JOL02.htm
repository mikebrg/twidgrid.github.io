  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Yet even now, saith the LORD, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God, for he is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, and repenteth him of the evil.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then was the LORD jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the LORD answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>but I will remove far off from you the northern <span class='add'>army</span>, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, his forepart into the eastern sea, and his hinder part into the western sea; and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for the LORD hath done great things.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first <span class='add'>month</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and there is none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as the LORD hath said, and among the remnant those whom the LORD doth call.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
