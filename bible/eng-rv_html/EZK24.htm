I also will make the pile great.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>She hath wearied <span class='add'>herself </span>with toil: yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her; her rust <span class='add'>goeth not forth </span>by fire.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have satisfied my fury upon thee.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead, bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So I spake unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died: and I did in the morning as I was commanded.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then I said unto them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do: when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters,   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: so shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
