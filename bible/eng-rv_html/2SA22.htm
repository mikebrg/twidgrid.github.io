and who is a rock, save our God?   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>God is my strong fortress: and he guideth the perfect in his way.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>He maketh his feet like hinds’ <span class='add'>feet</span>: and setteth me upon my high places.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>He teacheth my hands to war; so that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; neither did I turn again till they were consumed.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, that they cannot arise; yea, they are fallen under my feet.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, that I might cut off them that hate me.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people; thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>The strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>The strangers shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their close places.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation:   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, and bringeth down peoples under me,   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me: thou deliverest me from the violent man.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the nations, and will sing praises unto thy name.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Great deliverance giveth he to his king: and sheweth lovingkindness to his anointed, to David and to his seed, for evermore.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
