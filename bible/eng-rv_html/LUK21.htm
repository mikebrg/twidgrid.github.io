for there shall be great distress upon the land, and wrath unto this people.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive into all the nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads; because your redemption draweth nigh.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he spake to them a parable: Behold the fig tree, and all the trees:   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>when they now shoot forth, ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Even so ye also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all things be accomplished.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But take heed to yourselves, lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come on you suddenly as a snare:   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>for <span class='add'>so </span>shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But watch ye at every season, making supplication, that ye may prevail to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And every day he was teaching in the temple; and every night he went out, and lodged in the mount that is called <span class='add'>the mount </span>of Olives.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
