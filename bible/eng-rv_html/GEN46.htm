And he said, Here am I.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.
