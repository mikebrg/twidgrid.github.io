</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me, for anguish hath taken hold of me; because my life is yet whole in me.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’S anointed.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he bade them teach the children of Judah <span class='add'>the song of </span>the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! how are the mighty fallen!   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet delicately, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!   </div><ul class='tnav'>
