but thou art man, and not God, in the hand of him that woundeth thee.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou wast in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was in thee; in the day that thou wast created they were prepared.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou wast the anointed cherub that covereth: and I set thee, <span class='add'>so that </span>thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>By the multitude of they traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore, have I cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; and I have destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I have cast thee to the ground, I have laid thee before kings, that they may behold thee.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>By the multitude of thine iniquities, in the unrighteousness of thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries; therefore have I brought forth a fire from the midst of thee, it hath devoured thee, and I have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee: thou art become a terror, and thou shalt never be any more.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Son of man, set thy face toward Zidon, and prophesy against it,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I will send into her pestilence and blood in her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor a grieving thorn of any that are round about them, that did despite unto them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave my servant Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they shall dwell securely therein; yea, they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell securely; when I have executed judgments upon all those that do them despite round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
