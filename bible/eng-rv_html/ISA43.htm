I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The beasts of the field shall honour me, the jackals and the ostriches: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen:   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>the people which I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Yet thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not made thee to serve with offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake; and I will not remember thy sins.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: set thou forth <span class='add'>thy cause</span>, that thou mayest be justified.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Thy first father sinned, and thine interpreters have transgressed against me.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary, and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
