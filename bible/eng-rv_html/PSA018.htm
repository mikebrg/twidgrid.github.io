<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='d'>For the Chief Musician. <span class='add'>A Psalm </span>of David the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and he said, </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I love thee, O LORD, my strength.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strong rock, in him will I trust; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The cords of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The cords of Sheol were round about me: the snares of death came on me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry before him came into his ears.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then the earth shook and trembled, me foundations also of the mountains moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly, yea, he flew swiftly upon the wings of the wind.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion round about him; darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice; hailstones and coals of fire.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid bare, at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He sent from on high, he took me; he drew me out of many waters.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They came upon me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For all his judgments were before me, and I put not away his statutes from me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I was also perfect with him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with the perfect man thou wilt shew thyself perfect;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt shew thyself froward.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For thou wilt light my lamp: the LORD my God will lighten my darkness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For by thee I run upon a troop; and by my God do I leap over a wall.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried; he is a shield unto all them that trust in him.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, beside our God?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He maketh my feet like hinds’ <span class='add'>feet</span>: and setteth me upon my high places,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>He teacheth my hands to war; so that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them: neither will I turn again till they are consumed.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I will smite them through that they shall not be able to rise: they shall fall under my feet.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, that I might cut off them that hate me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>They cried, but there was none to save: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; thou hast made me the head of the nations: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>The strangers shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their close places.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of my salvation:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, and subdueth peoples under me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>He rescueth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me: thou deliverest me from the violent man.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the nations, and will sing praises unto thy name.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Great deliverance giveth he to his king;
