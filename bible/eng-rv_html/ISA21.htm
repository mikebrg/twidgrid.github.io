<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it cometh from the wilderness, from a terrible land.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>My heart panteth, horror hath affrighted me: the twilight that I desired hath been turned into trembling unto me.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman; let him declare what he seeth:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and when he seeth a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of asses, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and, behold, here cometh a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>O thou my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The burden of Dumah. One calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: turn ye, come.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanites.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Unto him that was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitives with their bread.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few: for the LORD, the God of Israel, hath spoken it.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
