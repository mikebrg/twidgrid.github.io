And they slept both that night.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Raguel arose, and went and digged a grave,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>saying, Lest he also should die.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Raguel came into his house,   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and said to Edna his wife, Send one of the maidservants, and let them see whether he be alive: but if not, that we may bury him, and no man know it.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So the maidservant opened the door, and went in, and found them both sleeping,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and came forth, and told them that he was alive.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Raguel blessed God, saying,  </div><div class='p'>Blessed art thou, O God, with all pure and holy blessing; and let thy saints bless thee, and all thy creatures; and let all thine angels and thine elect bless thee for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Blessed art thou, because thou hast made me glad; and it hath not befallen me as I suspected; but thou hast dealt with us according to thy great mercy.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Blessed art thou, because thou hast had mercy on two that were the only begotten children of their parents: shew them mercy, O Lord; accomplish their life in health with gladness and mercy.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But he commanded his servants to fill the grave.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he kept the wedding feast for them fourteen days.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And before the days of the wedding feast were finished, Raguel sware unto him, that he should not depart till the fourteen days of the wedding feast were fulfilled;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and that then he should take the half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and the rest, <span class='add'>said he, </span> when I and my wife shall die.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
