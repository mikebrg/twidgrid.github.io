For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of Jabbok.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that he had.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, <span class='add'>said he</span>, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he halted upon his thigh.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
