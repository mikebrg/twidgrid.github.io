I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: it was winter;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>My Father, which hath given <span class='add'>them </span>unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch <span class='add'>them </span>out of the Father’s hand.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I and the Father are one.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The Jews took up stones again to stone him.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am <span class='add'>the </span>Son of God?   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he abode.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And many believed on him there.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
