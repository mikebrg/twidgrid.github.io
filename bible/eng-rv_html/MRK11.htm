And his disciples heard it.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And every evening he went forth out of the city.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye have received them, and ye shall have them.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Many ancient authorites add ver. 26 But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and they said unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things?   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Jesus said unto them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But should we say, From men—they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus saith unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
