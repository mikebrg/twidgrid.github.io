what meaneth the heat of this great anger?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
