These things will I do, and I will not forsake them.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say unto molten images, Ye are our gods.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I send? who is blind as he that is at peace <span class='add'>with me</span>, and blind as the LORD’S servant?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou seest many things, but thou observest not; his ears are open, but he heareth not.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>It pleased the LORD, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the law, and make it honourable.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Who is there among you that will give ear to this? that will hearken and hear for the time to come?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD? he against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient unto his law.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore he poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
