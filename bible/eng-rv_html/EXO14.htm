And they did so.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel, for the children of Israel went out with an high hand.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses <span class='add'>and </span>chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one came not near the other all the night.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go <span class='add'>back </span>by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the morning watch, that the LORD looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Israel saw the great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared the LORD: and they believed in the LORD, and in his servant Moses.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
