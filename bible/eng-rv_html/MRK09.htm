And he said, From a child.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and <span class='add'>the child </span>became as one dead; insomuch that the more part said, He is dead.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, <span class='add'>saying</span>, We could not cast it out.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he said unto them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And they went forth from thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were ye reasoning in the way?   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another in the way, who <span class='add'>was </span>the greatest.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he saith unto them, If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and minister of all.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he took a little child, and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them,   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>John said unto him, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name: and we forbade him, because he followed not us.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For he that is not against us is for us.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink, because ye are Christ’s, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And if thy hand cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Ver. 44 and 46 (which are identical with ver. 48) are omitted by the best ancient authorities.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And if thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Ver. 44 and 46 (which are identical with ver. 48) are omitted by the best ancient authorities.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And if thine eye cause thee to stumble, cast it out: it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>For every one shall be salted with fire.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it?
