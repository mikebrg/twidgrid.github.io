If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now if we put the horses’ bridles into their mouths, that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Behold, the ships also, though they are so great, and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>but the tongue can no man tame; <span class='add'>it is </span>a restless evil, <span class='add'>it is </span>full of deadly poison.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the likeness of God:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet <span class='add'>water </span>and bitter?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither <span class='add'>can </span>salt water yield sweet.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Who is wise and understanding among you? let him shew by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>This wisdom is not <span class='add'>a wisdom </span>that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
