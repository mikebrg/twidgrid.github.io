They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely <span class='add'>as men </span>averse from war.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie, <span class='add'>saying</span>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah: as a flock in the midst of their pasture, they shall make great noise by reason of <span class='add'>the multitude of </span>men.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat: and their king is passed on before them, and the LORD at the head of them.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
