And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, <span class='add'>and </span>its blossoms shot forth; <span class='add'>and </span>the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
