The Lord is at hand.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honourable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Howbeit ye did well, that ye had fellowship with my affliction.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving, but ye only;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things <span class='add'>that came </span>from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And my God shall fulfill every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now unto our God and Father <span class='add'>be </span>the glory for ever and ever. Amen.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me salute you.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar’s household.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
