And he said unto them,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>then shall ye begin to say, We did eat and drink in thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>There shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth without.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they shall come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill thee.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Go and say to that fox, Behold, I cast out devils and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third <span class='add'>day </span>I am perfected.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Howbeit I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the <span class='add'>day </span>following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen <span class='add'>gathereth </span>her own brood under her wings, and ye would not!   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Behold, your house is left unto you <span class='add'>desolate</span>: and I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until ye shall say, Blessed <span class='add'>is </span>he that cometh in the name of the Lord.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
