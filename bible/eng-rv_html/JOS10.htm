Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fenced cities,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof; he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein, he left none remaining: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of Jericho.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>and the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So Joshua smote all the land, the hill country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings; he left none remaining: but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
