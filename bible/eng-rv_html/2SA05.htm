<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six mouths: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion; the same is the city of David.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And David said on that day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and <span class='add'>smite </span>the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul. Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And David dwelt in the strong hold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And David waxed greater and greater; for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and Ibhar, and Elishua; and Nepheg, and Japhia;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thine hand.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, The LORD hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then is the LORD gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And David did so, as the LORD commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
