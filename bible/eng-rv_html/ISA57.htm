Shall I be appeased for these things?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed: thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy memorial: for thou hast discovered <span class='add'>thyself </span>to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou didst find a quickening of thy strength; therefore thou wast not faint.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou liest, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of long time, and fearest me not?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will declare thy righteousness; and as for thy works, they shall not profit thee.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When thou criest, let them which thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth and smote him, I hid <span class='add'>my face </span>and was wroth: and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
