This is he that was sown by the way side.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But when the blade sprang up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil <span class='add'>one</span>;   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.   <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?   <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?   <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?   <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.   <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
