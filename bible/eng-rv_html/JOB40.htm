I lay mine hand upon my mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Wilt thou even disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Or hast thou an arm like God? and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; and array thyself with honour and majesty.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger: and look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Look on every one that is proud, <span class='add'>and </span>bring him low; and tread down the wicked where they stand.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in the hidden <span class='add'>place</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then wilt I also confess of thee that thine own right hand can save thee.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as all ox.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the muscles of his belly.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his thighs are knit together.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>His bones are as tubes of brass; his limbs are like bars of iron.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He is the chief of the ways of God: he <span class='add'>only </span>that made him can make his sword to approach <span class='add'>unto him</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Surely the mountains bring him forth food; where all the beasts of the field do play.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He lieth under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the fen.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The lotus trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not: he is confident, though Jordan swell even to his mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?   </div><ul class='tnav'>
