And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me depart in any wise.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And God raised up <span class='add'>another </span>adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, which had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them <span class='add'>of Zobah</span>: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad <span class='add'>did</span>: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, he also lifted up his hand against the king.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labour of the house of Joseph.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now <span class='add'>Ahijah </span>had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and <span class='add'>to keep </span>my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in mine eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for over.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam: but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
