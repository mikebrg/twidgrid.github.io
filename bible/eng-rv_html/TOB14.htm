See, my child, what Aman did to Achiacharus that nourished him, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and all the recompense that he made him: and Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his recompense, and he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snare of death which he set for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now, my children, consider what alms doeth, and how righteousness doth deliver.  </div><div class='p'>And while he was saying these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed; but he was a hundred and eight and fifty years old; and he buried him magnificently.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when Anna died, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and his sons to Ecbatana unto Raguel his father in law,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and he grew old in honour, and he buried his father and mother in law magnificently, and he inherited their substance, and his father Tobit’s.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he died at Ecbatana of Media, being a hundred and seven and twenty years old.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineveh, which Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus took captive; and before his death he rejoiced over Nineveh.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
