So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and he changed his prison garments, and did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
