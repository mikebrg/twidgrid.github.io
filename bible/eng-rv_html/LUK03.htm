And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither exact <span class='add'>anything </span>wrongfully; and be content with your wages.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and <span class='add'>with </span>fire:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>whose fan is in his hand, throughly to cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>With many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that, Jesus also having been baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily form, as a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Jesus himself, when he began <span class='add'>to teach</span>, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Heli,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Matthat, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Levi, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Melchi, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Jannai, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Joseph,   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Mattathias, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Amos, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Nahum, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Esli, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Naggai,   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Maath, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Mattathias, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Semein, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Josech, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Joda,   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Joanan, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Rhesa, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Zerubbabel, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Shealtiel, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Neri,   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Melchi, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Addi, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Cosam, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Elmadam, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Er,   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Jesus, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Eliezer, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Jorim, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Matthat, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Levi,   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Symeon, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Judas, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Joseph, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Jonam, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Eliakim,   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Melea, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Menna, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Mattatha, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Nathan, the <span class='add'>son </span>of David,   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Jesse, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Obed, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Boaz, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Salmon, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Nahshon,   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Amminadab, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Arni, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Hezron, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Perez, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Judah,   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Jacob, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Isaac, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Abraham, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Terah, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Nahor,   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Serug, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Reu, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Peleg, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Eber, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Shelah,   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Cainan, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Arphaxad, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Shem, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Noah, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Lamech,   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Methuselah, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Enoch, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Jared, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Mahalaleel, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Cainan,   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>the <span class='add'>son </span>of Enos, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Seth, the <span class='add'>son </span>of Adam, the <span class='add'>son </span>of God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
