Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, and saying,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and suffereth grievously: for oft-times he falleth into the fire, and oft-times into the water.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him hither to me.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Jesus rebuked him; and the devil went out from him: and the boy was cured from that hour.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he saith unto them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Many authorities, some ancient, insert ver. 21, But this kind goeth not out save by prayer and fasting.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised up. And they were exceeding sorry.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay the half-shekel?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He saith, Yea. And when he came into the house, Jesus spake first to him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive toll or tribute? from their sons, or from strangers?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said unto him, Therefore the sons are free.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But, lest we cause them to stumble, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a shekel: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
