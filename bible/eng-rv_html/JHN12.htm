Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, <span class='add'>saying</span>, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <span class='add'>it</span>, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>For I spake not from myself; but the Father which sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
