Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.)   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And great hail, <span class='add'>every stone </span>about the weight of a talent, cometh down out of heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is exceeding great.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
