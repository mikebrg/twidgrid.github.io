And they said, We are witnesses.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now therefore put away, <span class='add'>said he</span>, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD, the God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and unto his voice will we hearken.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of the LORD, that he had wrought for Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of money: and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
