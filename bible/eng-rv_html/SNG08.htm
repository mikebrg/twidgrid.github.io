Under the apple tree I awakened thee: there thy mother was in travail with thee, there was she in travail that brought thee forth.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, a very flame of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he would utterly be contemned.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If she be a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver: and if she be a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers <span class='add'>thereof</span>: then was I in his eyes as one that found peace.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand <span class='add'>pieces </span>of silver.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken for thy voice: cause me to hear it.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
