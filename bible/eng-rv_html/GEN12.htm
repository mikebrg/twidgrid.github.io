And the Canaanite was then in the land.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she-asses, and camels.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so that I took her to be my wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
