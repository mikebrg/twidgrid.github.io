And as for the flesh, every one that is clean shall eat thereof:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when any one shall touch any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean abomination, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, that soul shall be cut off from his people.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD out of the sacrifice of his peace offerings:   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>his own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For the wave breast and the heave thigh have I taken of the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as a due for ever from the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>This is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest’s office;   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is a due for ever throughout their generations.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings;   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
