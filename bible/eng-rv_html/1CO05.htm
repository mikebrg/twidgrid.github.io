Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, <span class='add'>even </span>Christ:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>but now I write unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>whereas them that are without God judgeth? Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
