Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>the sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>the sons of Rachel; Joseph and Benjamin:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan and Naphtali:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Paddan-aram.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
