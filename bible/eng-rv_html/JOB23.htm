Nay; but he would give heed unto me.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There the upright might reason with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Behold, I go forward, but he is not <span class='add'>there</span>; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But he knoweth the way that I take; when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>My foot hath held fast to his steps; his way have I kept, and turned not aside.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But he is in one <span class='add'>mind</span>, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For he performeth that which is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore am I troubled at his presence; when I consider, I am afraid of him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For God hath made my heart faint, and the Almighty hath troubled me:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
