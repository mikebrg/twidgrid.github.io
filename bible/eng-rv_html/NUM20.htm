And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered <span class='add'>unto his people</span>, and shall die there.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
