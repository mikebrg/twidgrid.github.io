These <span class='add'>are </span>they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, <span class='add'>to be </span>the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal gospel to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people;   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, which hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their works follow with them.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud <span class='add'>I saw </span>one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is over-ripe.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great <span class='add'>winepress</span>, of the wrath of God.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
