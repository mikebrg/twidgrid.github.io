Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and said, I beseech thee, O LORD, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: yea, I and my father’s house have sinned.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. (Now I was cupbearer to the king.)   </div><ul class='tnav'>
