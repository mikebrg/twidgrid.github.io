And <span class='add'>there were </span>seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and before the throne, as it were a glassy sea like unto crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the first creature <span class='add'>was </span>like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face as of a man, and the fourth creature <span class='add'>was </span>like a flying eagle.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and within: and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, <span class='add'>is </span>the Lord God, the Almighty, which was and which is and which is to come.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanks to him that sitteth on the throne, to him that liveth for ever and ever,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>the four and twenty elders shall fall down before him that sitteth on the throne, and shall worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, to receive the glory and the honour and the power: for thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
