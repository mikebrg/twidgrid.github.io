their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they journeyed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.   <span class="verse"

Jordan at Jericho, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over Jordan into the land of Canaan,   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured <span class='add'>stones</span>, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places:   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>and ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein: for unto you have I given the land to possess it.   <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit.   <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then shall those which ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.   <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, that as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
