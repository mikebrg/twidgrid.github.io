</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul, called <span class='add'>to be </span>an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>unto the church of God which is at Corinth, <span class='add'>even </span>them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <span class='add'>to be </span>saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their <span class='add'>Lord </span>and ours:   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>who shall also confirm you unto the end, <span class='add'>that ye be </span>unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <span class='add'>that </span>there be no divisions among you; but <span class='add'>that </span>ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them <span class='add'>which are of the household </span>of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For the word of the cross is to them that are perishing foolishness; but unto us which are being saved it is the power of God.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And the prudence of the prudent will I reject.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For behold your calling, brethren, how that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <span class='add'>are called</span>:   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, <span class='add'>yea </span>and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>that no flesh should glory before God.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
