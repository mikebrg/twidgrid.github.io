When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou hast made an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpiller gathereth: as locusts leap shall they leap upon it.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom and knowledge: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Behold, their valiant ones cry without: the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The land mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and withereth away: Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off <span class='add'>their leaves</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>How will I arise, saith the LORD; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath surprised the godless ones. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: his bread shall be given <span class='add'>him</span>; his waters shall be sure.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a far stretching land.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thine heart shall muse on the terror: where is he that counted, where is he that weighed <span class='add'>the tribute</span>? where is he that counted the towers?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not perceive; of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But there the LORD will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
