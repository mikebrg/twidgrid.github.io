And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of the LORD stood by.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these that stand by.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men which are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
