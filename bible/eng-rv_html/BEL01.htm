</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>AND king Astyages was gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus the Persian received his kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Daniel lived with the king, and was honoured above all his friends.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now the Babylonians had an idol, called Bel, and there were spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six firkins of wine.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the king did honour to it, and went daily to worship it: but Daniel worshipped his own God. And the king said unto him, Why dost thou not worship Bel?   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he said, Because I may not do honour to idols made with hands, but to the living God, who hath created the heaven and the earth, and hath sovereignty over all flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then said the king unto him, Thinkest thou not that Bel is a living god? or seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then Daniel laughed, and said, O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, and did never eat or drink anything.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So the king was wroth, and called for his priests, and said unto them, If ye tell me not who this is that devoureth these expenses, ye shall die.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But if ye can shew me that Bel devoureth them, then Daniel shall die: for he hath spoken blasphemy against Bel. And Daniel said unto the king, Let it be according to thy word.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now the priests of Bel were threescore and ten, beside their wives and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So Bel’s priests said, Lo, we will get us out: but thou, O king, set on the meat, and mingle the wine and set it forth, and shut the door fast, and seal it with thine own signet;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and when thou comest in the morning, if thou find not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will suffer death: or else Daniel, that speaketh falsely against us.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they little regarded it: for under the table they had made a privy entrance, whereby they entered in continually, and consumed those things.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when they were gone forth, the king set the meat before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes, and they strewed all the temple <span class='add'>with them </span> in the presence of the king alone: then went they out, and shut the door, and sealed it with the king’s signet, and so departed.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now in the night came the priests with their wives and children, as they were wont to do, and did eat and drink up all.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In the morning betime the king arose, and Daniel with him.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the king said, Daniel, are the seals whole? And he said, Yea, O king, they be whole.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked upon the table, and cried with a loud voice, Great art thou, O Bel, and with thee is no deceit at all.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then laughed Daniel, and held the king that he should not go in, and said, Behold now the pavement, and mark well whose footsteps are these.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the king said, I see the footsteps of men, women, and children. And then the king was angry,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and took the priests with their wives and children, who shewed him the privy doors, where they came in, and consumed such things as were upon the table.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore the king slew them, and delivered Bel into Daniel’s power, who overthrew him and his temple.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And in that same place there was a great <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Or, serpent </span></a> dragon, which they of Babylon worshipped.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the king said unto Daniel, Wilt thou also say that this is of brass? lo, he liveth, and eateth and drinketh; thou canst not say that he is no living god: therefore worship him.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then said Daniel, I will worship the Lord my God: for he is a living God.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But give me leave, O king, and I shall slay this dragon without sword or staff. The king said, I give thee leave.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and did seethe them together, and made lumps thereof: this he put in the dragon’s mouth, so the dragon did eat and burst in sunder: and <span class='add'>Daniel </span> said, Lo, these are the gods ye worship.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>When they of Babylon heard that, they took great indignation, and conspired against the king, saying, The king is become a Jew, and he hath pulled down Bel, and slain the dragon, and put the priests to the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So they came to the king, and said, Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy thee and thine house.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now when the king saw that they pressed him sore, being constrained, the king delivered Daniel unto them:   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>who cast him into the lion’s den: where he was six days.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given them every day two carcases, and two sheep: which then were not given to them, to the intent they might devour Daniel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Now there was in Jewry the prophet <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Gr. Ambakoum. </span></a> Habakkuk, who had made pottage, and had broken bread into a bowl, and was going into the field, for to bring it to the reapers.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But the angel of the Lord said unto Habakkuk, Go carry the dinner that thou hast into Babylon unto Daniel, in the lions’ den.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Habakkuk said, Lord, I never saw Babylon; neither do I know where the den is.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown, and lifted him up by the hair of his head, and with the blast of his breath set him in Babylon over the den.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Habakkuk cried, saying, O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner which God hath sent thee.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, O God: neither hast thou forsaken them that love thee.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>So Daniel arose, and did eat: and the angel of God set Habakkuk in his own place again immediately.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Upon the seventh day the king came to bewail Daniel: and when he came to the den, he looked in, and, behold, Daniel was sitting.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then cried the king with a loud voice, saying, Great art thou, O Lord, thou God of Daniel, and there is none other beside thee.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And he drew him out, and cast those that were the cause of his destruction into the den: and they were devoured in a moment before his face.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
