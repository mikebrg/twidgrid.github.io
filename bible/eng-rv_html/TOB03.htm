And they said unto her, Dost thou not know that thou stranglest thy husbands? thou hast had already seven husbands, and thou hast had no profit of any one of them.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Wherefore dost thou scourge us? if they be dead, go thy ways with them; let us never see of thee either son or daughter.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When she heard these things, she was grieved exceedingly, so that she thought to have hanged herself: and she said, I am the only daughter of my father; if I do this, it shall be a reproach unto him, and I shall bring down his old age with sorrow to <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Gr. Hades. </span></a> the grave.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And she prayed by the window, and said, Blessed art thou, O Lord my God, and blessed is thy holy and honourable name for ever: let all thy works praise thee for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And now, Lord, I have set mine eyes and my face toward thee:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>command that I be released from the earth, and that I no more hear reproach.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou knowest, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity: I am the only daughter of my father, and he hath no child that shall be his heir, nor brother near him, nor son belonging to him, that I should keep myself for a wife unto him: seven husbands of mine are dead already; why should I live? And if it pleaseth thee not to slay me, command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of me, and that I hear no more reproach.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the prayer of both was heard before the glory of the great <span class='add'>God. </span>   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Raphael also was sent to heal them both, to scale away the white films from Tobit’s eyes, and to give Sarah the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodaeus the evil <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">Gr. demon. </span></a> spirit; because it belonged to Tobias that he should inherit her. The selfsame time did Tobit return and enter into his house, and Sarah the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
