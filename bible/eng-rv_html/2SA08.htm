And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought presents.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought presents. And the LORD gave victory to David whithersoever he went.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And <span class='add'>Joram </span>brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>These also did king David dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David.
