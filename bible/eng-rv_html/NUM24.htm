Blessed be every one that blesseth thee, And cursed be every one that curseth thee.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; what the LORD speaketh, that will I speak?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And now, behold, I go unto my people: come, <span class='add'>and </span>I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, And the man whose eye was closed saith:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He saith, which heareth the words of God, And knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, Which seeth the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I see him, but not now: I behold him, but not nigh: There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, And shall smite through the corners of Moab, And break down all the sons of tumult.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, <span class='add'>which were </span>his enemies; While Israel doeth valiantly.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And out of Jacob shall one have dominion, And shall destroy the remnant from the city.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; But his latter end shall come to destruction.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling place, And thy nest is set in the rock.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But ships <span class='add'>shall come </span>from the coast of Kittim, And they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, And he also shall come to destruction.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
