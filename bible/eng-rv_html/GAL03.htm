He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now this I say; A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; <span class='add'>and it was </span>ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now a mediator is not <span class='add'>a mediator </span>of one; but God is one.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Howbeit the scripture hath shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So that the law hath been our tutor <span class='add'>to bring us </span>unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female: for ye all are one <span class='add'>man </span>in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
