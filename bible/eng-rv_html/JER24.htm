And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
