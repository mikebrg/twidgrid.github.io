Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate; and he compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fenced cities of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he built up the altar of the LORD, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, but only unto the LORD their God.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>His prayer also, and how <span class='add'>God </span>was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
