The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And it was an handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt offering they washed in them: but the sea was for the priests to wash in.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he set the sea on the right side <span class='add'>of the house </span>eastward, toward the south.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons.
