The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they which eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But <span class='add'>I say</span>, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with devils.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>All things are lawful; but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful; but all things edify not.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Let no man seek his own, but <span class='add'>each </span>his neighbour’s <span class='add'>good</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience sake;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>If one of them that believe not biddeth you <span class='add'>to a feast</span>, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake:   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>If I by grace partake, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Give no occasion of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the <span class='add'>profit </span>of the many, that they may be saved.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
