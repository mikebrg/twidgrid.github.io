And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
