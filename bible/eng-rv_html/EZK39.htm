Thus shall they cleanse the land.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD: Speak unto the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God, from that day and forward.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I unto them; and I hid my face from them.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>when I have brought them again from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them unto their own land; and I will leave none of them any more there;   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
