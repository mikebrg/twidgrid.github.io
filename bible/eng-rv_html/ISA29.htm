Shall the potter be counted as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing framed say of him that framed it, He hath no understanding?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be counted for a forest?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off:   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>that make a man an offender in a cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall learn doctrine.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
