<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest thou peaceably?   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’S anointed is before him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for <span class='add'>the LORD seeth </span>not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now the spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man who is a cunning player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty man of valour, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jesse took an ass <span class='add'>laden </span>with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the <span class='add'>evil </span>spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
