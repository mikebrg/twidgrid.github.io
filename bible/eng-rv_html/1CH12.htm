Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle, but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall away to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands that were of Manasseh.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they helped David against the band of rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For from day to day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And these are the numbers of the heads of them that were armed for war, which came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Jehoiada was the leader of <span class='add'>the house of </span>Aaron, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred;   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house twenty and two captains.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And of the children of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous men in their fathers’ houses.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the host, that could set the battle in array, with all manner of instruments of war, fifty thousand; and that could order <span class='add'>the battle array, and were </span>not of double heart.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And of the Danites that could set the battle in array, twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And of Asher, such as were able to go out in the host, that could set the battle in array, forty thousand.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>All these, being men of war, that could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had made preparation for them.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Moreover they that were nigh unto them, <span class='add'>even </span>as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, victual of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel:   </div><ul class='tnav'>
