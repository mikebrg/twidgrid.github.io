And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the breath of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up into the high mountain: O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Behold, the Lord GOD will come as a mighty one, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his recompence before him.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He shall feed his flock like a shepherd, he shall gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, <span class='add'>and </span>shall gently lead those that give suck.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Who hath directed the spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor hath taught him?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>All the nations are as nothing before him; they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The graven image, a workman melted <span class='add'>it</span>, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth <span class='add'>for it </span>silver chains.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He that is too impoverished for <span class='add'>such </span>an oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to set up a graven image, that shall not be moved.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span><span class='add'>It is </span>he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>that bringeth princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Yea, they have not been planted; yea, they have not been sown; yea, their stock hath not taken root in the earth: moreover he bloweth upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal <span class='add'>to him</span>? saith the Holy One.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed away from my God?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary; there is no searching of his understanding.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>but they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
