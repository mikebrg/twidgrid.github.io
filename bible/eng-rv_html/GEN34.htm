only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went forth.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and spoiled, even all that was in the house.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
