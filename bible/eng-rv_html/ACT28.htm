who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when this was done, the rest also which had diseases in the island came, and were cured:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>who also honoured us with many honours; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius, and The Three Taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught to accuse my nation of.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with <span class='add'>me</span>: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded <span class='add'>the matter</span>, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>saying, Go thou unto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For this people’s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Some ancient authorities insert ver. 29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him,   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
