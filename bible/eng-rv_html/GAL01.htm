 <div class='mt2'>THE EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE  </div><div class='mt'>GALATIANS.   
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>and all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>to whom <span class='add'>be </span>the glory for ever and ever. Amen.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>which is not another <span class='add'>gospel</span>: only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For am I now persuading men, or God? or am I seeking to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but <span class='add'>it came to me </span>through revelation of Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havock of it:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, <span class='add'>even </span>from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havock;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and they glorified God in me.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
