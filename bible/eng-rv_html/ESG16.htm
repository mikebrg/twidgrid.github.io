  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>having by manifold and cunning deceits sought <span class='add'>of us </span> the destruction, as well of Mardocheus, who saved our life, and continually procured our good, as also of Esther the blameless partaker of our kingdom, together with their whole nation.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For by these means he thought, finding us destitute <span class='add'>of friends</span>, to have translated the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But we find that the Jews, whom this most ungracious wretch hath delivered to utter destruction, are no evil-doers, but live by most just laws:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and that they be children of the most high and most mighty living God, who hath ordered the kingdom both unto us and to our progenitors in the most excellent manner.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Wherefore ye shall do well not to put in execution the letters sent unto you by Aman the son of Amadathus.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For he, that was the worker of these things, is hanged at the gates of Susa with all his family: God, who ruleth all things, speedily rendering vengeance to him according to his deserts.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore ye shall publish openly the copy of this letter in all places, and let the Jews live after their own laws,   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and ye shall aid them, that even the same day, being the thirteenth day of the twelfth month Adar, they may defend themselves against those who set upon them in the time of their affliction.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For Almighty God hath made this day to be a joy unto them, instead of the destruction of the chosen people.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And ye shall therefore among your commemorative feasts keep it a high day with all feasting:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>that both now and hereafter there may be safety to us, and the well affected Persians; but to those which do conspire against us a memorial of destruction.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore every city or country whatsoever, which shall not do according to these things, shall be utterly destroyed without mercy with <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Gr. spear and fire. </span></a> fire and sword; it shall be made not only unpassable for men, but also most hateful to wild beasts and fowls for ever.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
