When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The soul that sinneth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord GOD: and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth therein; in his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereto ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
