Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore <span class='add'>the scripture </span>saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>One <span class='add'>only </span>is the lawgiver and judge, <span class='add'>even </span>he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest thy neighbour?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Go to now, ye that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
