And exercise thyself unto godliness:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For to this end we labour and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>These things command and teach.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
