And he said, I am.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the manner of the child, and <span class='add'>what shall be </span>his work?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt make ready a burnt offering, thou must offer it onto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy words come to pass we may do thee honour?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So Manoah took the kid with the meal offering, and offered it upon the rock unto the LORD: and <span class='add'>the angel </span>did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would at this time have told us such things as these.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the spirit of the LORD began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
