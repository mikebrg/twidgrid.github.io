And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that whosoever findeth me shall slay me.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael: and Methushael begat Lamech.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and <span class='add'>have </span>cattle.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For, <span class='add'>said she</span>, God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
