And his mother said, Blessed be my son of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he restored the eleven hundred <span class='add'>pieces </span>of silver to his mother, and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred <span class='add'>pieces </span>of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the man Micah had an house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find <span class='add'>a place</span>: and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find <span class='add'>a place</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten <span class='add'>pieces </span>of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
