Mine eyes shall behold her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>In that day shall they come unto thee, from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and <span class='add'>from </span>mountain to mountain.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvelous things.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places: they shall come with fear unto the LORD our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He will turn again and have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot: and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, <span class='add'>and </span>the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
