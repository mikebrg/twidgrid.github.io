Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, unto this day.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn, in the selfsame day.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he said, Nay; but <span class='add'>as </span>captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the captain of the LORD’S host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
