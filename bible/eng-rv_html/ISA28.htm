and whom will he make to understand the message? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Nay, but by <span class='add'>men of </span>strange lips and with another tongue will he speak to this people:   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>to whom he said, This is the rest, give ye rest to him that is weary; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore shall the word of the LORD be unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner <span class='add'>stone </span>of sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I will make judgment the line, and righteousness the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>As often as it passeth through, it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night: and it shall be nought but terror to understand the message.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Now therefore be ye not scorners, lest your bands be made strong: for a consummation, and that determined, have I heard from the Lord, the LORD of hosts, upon the whole earth.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Doth the plowman plow continually to sow? doth he <span class='add'>continually </span>open and break the clods of his ground?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and put in the wheat in rows and the barley in the appointed place and the spelt in the border thereof?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For his God doth instruct him aright, <span class='add'>and </span>doth teach him.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For the fitches are not threshed with a sharp <span class='add'>threshing </span>instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Bread <span class='add'>corn </span>is ground; for he will not ever be threshing it: and though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it, he doth not grind it.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
