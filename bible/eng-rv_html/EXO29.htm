and thou shalt pour out all the blood at the base of the altar.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul upon the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and its dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou shalt also take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take its blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And thou shalt cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh; for it is a ram of consecration:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before the LORD:   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and thou shalt put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And thou shalt take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar upon the burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And thou shalt take the breast of Aaron’s ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy portion.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as a due for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, when he cometh into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And thou shalt take the ram of consecration, and seethe its flesh in a holy place.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they shall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate <span class='add'>and </span>to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>and with the one lamb a tenth part <span class='add'>of an ephah </span>of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meal offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before the LORD: where I will meet with you, to speak there unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and <span class='add'>the Tent </span>shall be sanctified by my glory.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar: Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to me in the priest’s office.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
