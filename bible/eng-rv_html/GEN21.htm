 <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.  
 <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_21_2	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 21:2	"><p><p>

 <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.  
 <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.   
 <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.  
 <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh; every one that heareth will laugh with me. 
 <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.  
 <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. 
  <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_21_8	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 21:8	"><p><p>

 <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne unto Abraham, mocking. 
   <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_21_9	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 21:9	"><p><p>

 <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. 
    <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_21_10	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 21:10	"><p><p>

 <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son.  
     <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_21_11	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 21:11	"><p><p>

 <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. 
 <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed. 
 <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_21_14	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 21:14	"><p><p>

 <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
 <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.  
 <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. 
 <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 
 <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.  
  <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_21_19	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 21:19	"><p><p>

 <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 
 <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 
 <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest: 
 <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. 
 <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Abraham said, I will swear.  
 <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.  
 <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but today.  
 <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant. 
 <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
 <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?  
 <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. 
 <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.  
 <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
