  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and say unto Tyre, O thou that dwellest at the entry of the sea, which art the merchant of the peoples unto many isles, thus saith the Lord GOD: Thou, O Tyre, hast said, I am perfect in beauty.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Thy borders are in the heart of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They have made all thy planks of fir trees from Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make a mast for thee.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, from the isles of Kittim.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy pilots.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Persia and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadim were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have perfected thy beauty.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for thy wares.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy merchandise.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They of the house of Togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war-horses and mules.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The men of Dedan were thy traffickers: many isles were the mart of thine hand: they brought thee in exchange horns of ivory and ebony.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of thy handyworks: they traded for thy wares with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy traffickers: they traded for thy merchandise wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Damascus was thy merchant for the multitude of thy handyworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with the wine of Helbon, and white wool.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for thy wares: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were among thy merchandise.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants of thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these were they thy merchants.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy traffickers: they traded for thy wares with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur <span class='add'>and </span>Chilmad were they traffickers.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>These were thy traffickers in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Thy riches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, with all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy ruin.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And all that handle the oar, the mariners, <span class='add'>and </span>all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land,   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and they shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Who is there like Tyre, like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea?   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many peoples; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>In the time that thou wast broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company did fall in the midst of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings are horribly afraid, they are troubled in their countenance.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The merchants among the peoples hiss at thee; thou art become a terror, and thou shalt never be any more.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
