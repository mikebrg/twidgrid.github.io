I have not lent on usury, neither have men lent to me on usury; <span class='add'>yet </span>every one of them doth curse me.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The LORD said, Verily I will strengthen thee for good; verily I will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will make <span class='add'>them </span>to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered reproach.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced: I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful <span class='add'>brook</span>, as waters that fail?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, that thou mayest stand before me; and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall return unto thee, but thou shalt not return unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
