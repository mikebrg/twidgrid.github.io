And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters, to come to Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And when they had crossed over, they came to the land, unto Gennesaret.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all that region round about, and brought unto him all that were sick;   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made whole.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
