</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to shew unto his servants, <span class='add'>even </span>the things which must shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified <span class='add'>it </span>by his angel unto his servant John;   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>who bare witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, <span class='add'>even </span>of all things that he saw.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him which is and which was and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and from Jesus Christ, <span class='add'>who is </span>the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loveth us, and loosed us from our sins by his blood;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and he made us <span class='add'>to be </span>a kingdom, <span class='add'>to be </span>priests unto his God and Father; to him <span class='add'>be </span>the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Behold, he cometh with the clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they which pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn over him. Even so, Amen.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, which is and which was and which is to come, the Almighty.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I John, your brother and partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patience <span class='add'>which are </span>in Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>saying, What thou seest, write in a book, and send <span class='add'>it </span>to the seven churches; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I turned to see the voice which spake with me. And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And his head and his hair were white as white wool, <span class='add'>white </span>as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and his feet like unto burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven churches.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
