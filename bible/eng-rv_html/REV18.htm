And every shipmaster, and every one that saileth any whither, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood afar off,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and cried out as they looked upon the smoke of her burning, saying, What <span class='add'>city </span>is like the great city?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, wherein were made rich all that had their ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and ye apostles, and ye prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on her.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And a strong angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and shall be found no more at all.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the voice of harpers and minstrels and flute-players and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft, shall be found any more at all in thee; and the voice of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the princes of the earth; for with thy sorcery were all the nations deceived.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
