Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>but if any man loveth God, the same is known of him.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is <span class='add'>anything </span>in the world, and that there is no God but one.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Howbeit in all men there is not that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as <span class='add'>of </span>a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But meat will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For if a man see thee which hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Wherefore, if meat maketh my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I make not my brother to stumble.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
