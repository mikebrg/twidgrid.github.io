  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD: This burden <span class='add'>concerneth </span>the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall go into exile, into captivity.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the ground with his eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For there shall be no more any vain vision, nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For I am the LORD; I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed; it shall be no more deferred: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, saith the Lord GOD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
