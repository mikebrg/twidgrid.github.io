(The same is called the land of Rephaim.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites; and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto this day.)   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I gave Gilead unto Machir.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border <span class='add'>thereof</span>; even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>the Arabah also, and Jordan and the border <span class='add'>thereof</span>, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the men of valour.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>until the LORD give rest unto your brethren, as unto you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God giveth them beyond Jordan: then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy mighty acts?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
