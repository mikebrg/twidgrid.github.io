why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbour, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear <span class='add'>the burden </span>with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
