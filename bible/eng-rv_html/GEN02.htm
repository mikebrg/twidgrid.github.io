And the fourth river is Euphrates.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found an help meet for him.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and the rib, which the LORD God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
