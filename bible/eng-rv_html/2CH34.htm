And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought the king word again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read therein before the king.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Go ye, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according unto all that is written in this book.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Hilkiah, and they whom the king <span class='add'>had commanded</span>, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spake to her to that effect.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: tell ye the man that sent you unto me,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought the king word again.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the king went up to the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand <span class='add'>to it</span>. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. All his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
