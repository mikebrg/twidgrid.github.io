And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For, behold, I will shake mine hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the LORD shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD: for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
