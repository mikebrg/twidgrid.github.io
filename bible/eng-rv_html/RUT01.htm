</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each of you to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they said unto her, Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have an husband to-night, and should also bear sons;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of the LORD is gone forth against me.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god: return thou after thy sister in law.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left speaking unto her.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and <span class='add'>the women </span>said, Is this Naomi?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
