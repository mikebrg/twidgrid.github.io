And David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying: So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
