<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 41</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits: and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he measured the length thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold <span class='add'>therein</span>, and not have hold in the wall of the house.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed <span class='add'>the house </span>higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house <span class='add'>continued </span>upward; and so one went up <span class='add'>from </span>the lowest <span class='add'>chamber </span>to the highest by the middle <span class='add'>chamber</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the doors of the side-chambers were toward <span class='add'>the place </span>that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long, and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the threshold, cieled with wood round about, and <span class='add'>from </span>the ground up to the windows; now the windows were covered;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>to <span class='add'>the space </span>above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it was made with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: <span class='add'>thus was it </span>made through all the house round about.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>As for the temple, the door posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance <span class='add'>thereof </span>was as the appearance <span class='add'>of the temple</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the doors had two leaves <span class='add'>apiece</span>, two turning leaves; two <span class='add'>leaves </span>for the one door, and two leaves for the other.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick beams of wood upon the face of the porch without.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thick beams.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
