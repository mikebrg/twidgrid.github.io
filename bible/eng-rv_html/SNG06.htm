Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that lie along the side of Gilead.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, which are come up from the washing; whereof every one hath twins, and none is bereaved among them.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>My dove, my undefiled, is <span class='add'>but </span>one; she is the only one of her mother; she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; <span class='add'>yea</span>, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, terrible as an army with banners?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, <span class='add'>and </span>the pomegranates were in flower.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Or ever I was aware, my soul set me <span class='add'>among </span>the chariots of my princely people.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Return, return, O Shulammite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, as upon the dance of Mahanaim?   </div><ul class='tnav'>
