Is it so, that there cannot be <span class='add'>found </span>among you one wise man, who shall be able to decide between his brethren,   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that <span class='add'>your </span>brethren.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up us through his power.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
