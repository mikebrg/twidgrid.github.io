And he went on his way till they drew near unto Nineveh.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Raphael said to Tobias, Knowest thou not, brother, how thou didst leave thy father?   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Let us run forward before thy wife, and prepare the house.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But take in thy hand the gall of the fish. And they went their way, and the dog went after them.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Anna sat looking about toward the way for her son.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And she espied him coming, and said to his father, Behold, thy son cometh, and the man that went with him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Raphael said, I know, Tobias, that thy father will open his eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Do thou therefore anoint his eyes with the gall, and being pricked therewith, he shall rub, and shall make the white films to fall away, and he shall see thee.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Anna ran unto him, and fell upon the neck of her son, and said unto him, I have seen thee, my child; from henceforth I will die. And they wept both.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Tobit went forth toward the door, and stumbled: but his son ran unto him,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and took hold of his father: and he strake the gall on his father’s eyes, saying, Be of good cheer, my father.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But when his eyes began to smart, he rubbed them;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and the white films scaled away from the corners of his eyes; and he saw his son, and fell upon his neck.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he wept, and said, Blessed art thou, O God, and blessed is thy name for ever, and blessed are all thy holy angels;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>for thou didst scourge, and didst have mercy on me: behold, I see my son Tobias. And his son went in rejoicing, and told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Tobit went out to meet his daughter in law at the gate of Nineveh, rejoicing, and blessing God: and they which saw him go marvelled, because he had received his sight.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Tobit gave thanks before them, because God had shewed mercy on him. And when Tobit came near to Sarah his daughter in law, he blessed her, saying, Welcome, daughter: blessed is God which hath brought thee unto us, and <span class='add'>blessed are </span> thy father and thy mother. And there was joy to all his brethren which were at Nineveh.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother’s son, came:   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and Tobias’ wedding feast was kept seven days with great gladness.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
