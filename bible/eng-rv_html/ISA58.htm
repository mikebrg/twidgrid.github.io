Behold, in the day of your fast ye find <span class='add'>your own </span>pleasure, and exact all your labours.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rearward.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, <span class='add'>and </span>the holy of the LORD honourable; and shalt honour it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking <span class='add'>thine own </span>words:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
