<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And as I was considering, behold, an he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him: but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable <span class='add'>horns </span>toward the four winds of heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious <span class='add'>land</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual <span class='add'>burnt offering</span>, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the host was given over <span class='add'>to it </span>together with the continual <span class='add'>burnt offering </span>through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did <span class='add'>its pleasure </span>and prospered.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one which spake, How long shall be the vision <span class='add'>concerning </span>the continual <span class='add'>burnt offering</span>, and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings <span class='add'>and </span>mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I heard a man’s voice between <span class='add'>the banks of </span>Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation: for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The ram which thou sawest that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do <span class='add'>his pleasure</span>: and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in <span class='add'>their </span>security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days <span class='add'>to come</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business: and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
