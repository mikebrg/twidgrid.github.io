<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth),   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in <span class='add'>my </span>weaknesses.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me <span class='add'>to be</span>, or heareth from me.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations—wherefore, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for <span class='add'>my </span>power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except <span class='add'>it be </span>that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not by the same Spirit? <span class='add'>walked we </span>not in the same steps?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, <span class='add'>are </span>for your edifying.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means <span class='add'>there should be </span>strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>lest, when I come again, my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
