when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>What shall I testify unto thee? what shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thy prophets have seen visions for thee of vanity and foolishness; and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to bring again thy captivity: but have seen for thee burdens of vanity and causes of banishment.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, <span class='add'>saying</span>: Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee; they hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up; certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The LORD hath done that which he devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old; he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Their heart cried unto the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night; give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches; pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the top of every street.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>See, O LORD, and behold, to whom thou hast done thus! shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast slaughtered, <span class='add'>and </span>not pitied.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side, and there was none that escaped or remained in the day of the LORD’S anger: those that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
