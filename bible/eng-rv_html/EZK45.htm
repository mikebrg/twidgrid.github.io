and fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And of this measure shalt thou measure, a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>It is an holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, which come near to minister unto the LORD; and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, <span class='add'>for </span>twenty chambers.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>whatsoever is </span>for the prince <span class='add'>shall be </span>on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward: and in length answerable unto one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah from an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from an homer of barley:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, shall be the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, <span class='add'>which is </span>ten baths, even an homer; for ten baths are an homer:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the fat pastures of Israel; for a meal offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>All the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it shall be the prince’s part to give the burnt offerings, and the meal offerings, and the drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meal offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: In the first <span class='add'>month</span>, in the first <span class='add'>day </span>of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the door posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And so thou shalt do on the seventh <span class='add'>day </span>of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye make atonement for the house.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>In the first <span class='add'>month</span>, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin offering.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil to an ephah.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In the seventh <span class='add'>month</span>, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days;
