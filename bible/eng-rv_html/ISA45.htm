or thy work, He hath no hands?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Woe unto him that saith unto a father, What begettest thou? or to a woman, with what travailest thou?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of the things that are to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let my exiles go free, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine; they shall go after thee; in chains they shall come over: and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They shall be ashamed, yea, confounded, all of them: they shall go into confusion together that are makers of idols.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span><span class='add'>But </span>Israel shall be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; he is God; that formed the earth and made it; he established it, he created it not a waste, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Declare ye, and bring <span class='add'>it </span>forth; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath shewed this from ancient time? who hath declared it of old? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a saviour; there is none beside me.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>By myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth <span class='add'>in </span>righteousness, and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Only in the LORD, shall one say unto me, is righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come, and all they that were incensed against him shall be ashamed.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
