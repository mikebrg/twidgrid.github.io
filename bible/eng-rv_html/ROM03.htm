<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision?   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God?   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and why not (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What then? are we in worse case than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Their feet are swift to shed blood;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Destruction and misery are in their ways;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the way of peace have they not known:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There is no fear of God before their eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for through the law <span class='add'>cometh </span>the knowledge of sin.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>whom God set forth <span class='add'>to be </span>a propitiation, through faith, by his blood, to shew his righteousness, because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>for the shewing, <span class='add'>I say</span>, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Or is God <span class='add'>the God </span>of Jews only? is he not <span class='add'>the God </span>of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
