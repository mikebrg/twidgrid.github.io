<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas;   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among the people.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For this <span class='add'>ointment </span>might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him <span class='add'>unto them</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now on the first <span class='add'>day </span>of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord?   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>for this is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many unto remission of sins.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, <span class='add'>yet </span>will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, <span class='add'>do </span>that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?   <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?   <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.   <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.   <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And they that had taken Jesus led him away to <span class='add'>the house of </span>Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.   <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.   <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;   <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two,   <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.   <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?   <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.   <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy:   <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.   <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,   <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?   <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean.   <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.   <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>And when he was gone out into the porch, another <span class='add'>maid </span>saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus the Nazarene.   <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.   <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art <span class='add'>one </span>of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.   <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span>Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.   <span class="verse" id="V75">75&#160;</span>And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
