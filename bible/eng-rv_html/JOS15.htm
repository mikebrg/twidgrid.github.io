And the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of Jordan:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem): and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of the vale of Rephaim northward:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and the border was drawn from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah (the same is Kiriath-jearim):   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and the border turned about from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim on the north (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shikkeron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the west border was to the great sea, and the border <span class='add'>thereof</span>.
