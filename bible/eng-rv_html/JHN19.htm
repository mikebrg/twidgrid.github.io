And <span class='add'>Pilate </span>saith unto them, Behold, the man!   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify <span class='add'>him</span>, crucify <span class='add'>him</span>. Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and he entered into the palace again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They therefore cried out, Away with <span class='add'>him</span>, away with <span class='add'>him</span>, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This title therefore read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, <span class='add'>and </span>in Latin, <span class='add'>and </span>in Greek.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the <span class='add'>wife </span>of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son!   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own <span class='add'>home</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high <span class='add'>day</span>), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <span class='add'>that </span>they might be taken away.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him:   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave <span class='add'>him </span>leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds <span class='add'>weight</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>There then because of the Jews’ Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
