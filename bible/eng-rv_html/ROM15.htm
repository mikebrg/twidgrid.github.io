For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it <span class='add'>to them </span>also to minister unto them in carnal things.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and <span class='add'>that </span>my ministration which <span class='add'>I have </span>for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
