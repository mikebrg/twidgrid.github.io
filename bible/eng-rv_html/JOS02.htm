And they went, and came into the house of an harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the land.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yea, the men came unto me, but I wist not whence they were:   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true token:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the men said unto her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business; and it shall be, when the LORD giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the men said unto her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if thou utter this our business, then we will be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
