Ye did me no wrong:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, <span class='add'>even </span>as Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So then am I become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you,   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>yea, I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I am perplexed about you.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Howbeit the <span class='add'>son </span>by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the <span class='add'>son </span>by the freewoman <span class='add'>is born </span>through promise.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Which things contain an allegory: for these <span class='add'>women </span>are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: For more are the children of the desolate than of her which hath the husband.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him <span class='add'>that was born </span>after the Spirit, even so it is now.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
