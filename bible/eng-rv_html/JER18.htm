Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it;   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But they say, There is no hope: for we will walk after our own devices, and we will do every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD: Ask ye now among the nations, who hath heard such things; the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? <span class='add'>or </span>shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity; and they have caused them to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths, in a way not cast up;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and shake his head.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will look upon their back, and not their face, in the day of their calamity.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away thy fury from them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives become childless, and widows; and let their men be slain of death, <span class='add'>and </span>their young men smitten of the sword in battle.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me; forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight: but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thou with them in the time of thine anger.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
