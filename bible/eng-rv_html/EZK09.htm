And they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, which had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>slay utterly the old man, the young man and the maiden, and little children and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wresting <span class='add'>of judgment</span>: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And behold, the man clothed in linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
