And, The labourer is worthy of his hire.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Against an elder receive not an accusation, except at <span class='add'>the mouth of </span>two or three witnesses.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Them that sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I charge <span class='add'>thee </span>in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Some men’s sins are evident, going before unto judgment; and some men also they follow after.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
