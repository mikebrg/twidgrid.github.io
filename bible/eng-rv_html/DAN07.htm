<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven brake forth upon the great sea.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in his mouth between his teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, <span class='add'>and </span>the wheels thereof burning fire.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and he was given to be burned with fire.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>As for me Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and concerning the ten horns that were on his head, and the other <span class='add'>horn </span>which came up, and before which three fell; even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High: and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
