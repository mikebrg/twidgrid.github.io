And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother in law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, unto the river Kishon.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera lighted down from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent-pin, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
