And Joseph was comely, and well favoured.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand;   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>there is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, <span class='add'>or </span>to be with her.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed kindness unto him, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand, because the LORD was with him; and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
