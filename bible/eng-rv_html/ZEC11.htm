And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them which are left eat every one the flesh of another.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it was broken in that day: and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew that it was the word of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty <span class='add'>pieces </span>of silver.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty <span class='add'>pieces </span>of silver, and cast them unto the potter, in the house of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek those that be scattered, nor heal that that is broken; neither shall he feed that which is sound, but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and shall tear their hoofs in pieces.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock, the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
