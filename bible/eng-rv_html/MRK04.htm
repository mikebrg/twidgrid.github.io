And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his teaching,   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow:   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and it came to pass, as he sowed, some <span class='add'>seed </span>fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And other fell on the rocky <span class='add'>ground</span>, where it had not much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables:   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The sower soweth the word.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky <span class='add'>places</span>, who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, <span class='add'>and </span>not to be put on the stand?   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was <span class='add'>anything </span>made secret, but that it should come to light.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you: and more shall be given unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth,   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it:   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith?   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?   </div><ul class='tnav'>
