And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the chief priests accused him of many things.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marveled.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And there was one called Barabbas, <span class='add'>lying </span>bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the multitude went up and began to ask him <span class='add'>to do </span>as he was wont to do unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they cried out again, Crucify him.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they clothe him with purple, and plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they smote his head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go <span class='add'>with them</span>, that he might bear his cross.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Many ancient authorities add ver. 28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was reckoned with transgressors.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>save thyself, and come down from the cross.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>In like manner also the chief priests mocking <span class='add'>him </span>among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And when the centurion, which stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom <span class='add'>were </span>both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor of honourable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And Mary Magdalene and Mary the <span class='add'>mother </span>of Joses beheld where he was laid.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
