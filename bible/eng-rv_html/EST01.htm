  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And this day shall the princesses of Persia and Media which have heard of the deed of the queen say <span class='add'>the like </span>unto all the king’s princes, So <span class='add'>shall there arise </span>much contempt and wrath.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should publish it according to the language of his people.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
