But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they were astonished exceedingly, saying unto him, Then who can be saved?   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel’s sake,   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But many <span class='add'>that are </span>first shall be last; and the last first.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they were in the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him,   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span><span class='add'>saying</span>, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles:   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him, and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three days he shall rise again.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And there come near unto him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying unto him, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on <span class='add'>thy </span>left hand, in thy glory.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And they said unto him, We are able. And Jesus said unto them, The cup that I drink ye shall drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>but to sit on my right hand or on <span class='add'>my </span>left hand is not mine to give: but <span class='add'>it is for them </span>for whom it hath been prepared.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>But it is not so among you: but whosoever would become great among you, shall be your minister:   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>and whosoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>For verily the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And Jesus stood still, and said, Call ye him. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth thee.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And straightway he received his sight, and followed him in the way.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
