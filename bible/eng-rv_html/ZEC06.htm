So they walked to and fro through the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon;   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>yea, take <span class='add'>of them </span>silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.
