These were the heads of the fathers’ <span class='add'>houses </span>of Ladan.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the sons of Shimei; Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The sons of Moses; Gershom and Eliezer.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The sons of Gershom; Shebuel the chief.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The sons of Hebron; Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The sons of Uzziel; Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The sons of Merari; Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar and Kish.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them <span class='add'>to wife</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ <span class='add'>houses </span>of those of them that were counted, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from twenty years old and upward.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For David said, The LORD, the God of Israel, hath given rest unto his people; and he dwelleth in Jerusalem for ever:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>for the shewbread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size;   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even;   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and to offer all burnt offerings unto the LORD, in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feast, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before the LORD:   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, for the service of the house of the LORD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
