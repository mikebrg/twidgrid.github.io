<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>not to many peoples of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of an hard forehead and of a stiff heart.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shalt speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>I heard </span>the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away: and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there astonied among them seven days.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood wilt I require at thine hand.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar: and I fell on my face.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
