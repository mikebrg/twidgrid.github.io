But we exhort you, brethren, that ye abound more and more;   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not, even as the rest, which have no hope.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
