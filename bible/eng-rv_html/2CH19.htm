And they returned to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall warn them, that they be not guilty towards the LORD, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not be guilty.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king’s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD be with the good.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
