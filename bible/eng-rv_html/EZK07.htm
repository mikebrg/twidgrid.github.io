and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: An evil, an only evil; behold, it cometh.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>An end is come, the end is come, it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near; <span class='add'>a day of </span>tumult, and not <span class='add'>of </span>joyful shouting, upon the mountains.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I the LORD do smite.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: thy doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them <span class='add'>shall remain</span>, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one in his iniquity.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD; they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations <span class='add'>and </span>their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret <span class='add'>place</span>: and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Make the chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
