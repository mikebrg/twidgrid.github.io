Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son’s mandrakes.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and she called his name Joseph, saying, The LORD add to me another son.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favour in thine eyes, <span class='add'>tarry</span>: <span class='add'>for </span>I have divined that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle hath fared with me.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and <span class='add'>of such </span>shall be my hire.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that <span class='add'>if found </span>with me shall be counted stolen.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>and he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane tree; and peeled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban’s flock.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and asses.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
