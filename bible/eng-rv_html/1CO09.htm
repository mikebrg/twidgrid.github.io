<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>My defence to them that examine me is this.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Have we no right to eat and to drink?   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>or saith he it altogether for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, <span class='add'>to thresh </span>in hope of partaking.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If others partake of <span class='add'>this </span>right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Know ye not that they which minister about sacred things eat <span class='add'>of </span>the things of the temple, <span class='add'>and </span>they which wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Even so did the Lord ordain that they which proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case: for <span class='add'>it were </span>good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For though I was free from all <span class='add'>men</span>, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I do all things for the gospel’s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run, that ye may attain.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And every man that striveth in the games is temperate in all things. Now they <span class='add'>do it </span>to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
