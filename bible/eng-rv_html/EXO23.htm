In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, <span class='add'>and </span>with thy oliveyard.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labours out of the field.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The first of the firstfruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Take ye heed of him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not: for he will not pardon your transgression; for my name is in him.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfill.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I will send my terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
