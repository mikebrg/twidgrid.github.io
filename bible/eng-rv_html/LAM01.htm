 <div class='mt'>THE LAMENTATIONS  </div><div class='mt2'>OF JEREMIAH.   
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! <span class='add'>how </span>is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, <span class='add'>and </span>princess among the provinces, <span class='add'>how </span>is she become tributary!   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude; she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her within the straits.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly; all her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old: when her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help her, the adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an unclean thing: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her latter end; therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter: behold, O LORD, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified himself.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen are entered into her sanctuary, concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to refresh the soul: see, O LORD, and behold; for I am become vile.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted <span class='add'>me </span>in the day of his fierce anger.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back; he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand; they are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail: the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me; he hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water; because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are round about him should be his adversaries: Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I called for my lovers, <span class='add'>but </span>they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought them meat to refresh their souls.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress; my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me; all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
