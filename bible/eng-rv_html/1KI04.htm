  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the levy.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Ben-hesed, in Arubboth;

and <span class='add'>he was </span>the only officer which was in the land.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For he had dominion over all <span class='add'>the region </span>on this side the River, from Tipsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides round about him.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they let nothing be lacking.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where <span class='add'>the officers </span>were, every man according to his charge.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
