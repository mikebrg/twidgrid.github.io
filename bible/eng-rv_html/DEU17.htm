So thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days: and thou shalt inquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and thou shalt do according to the tenor of the sentence, which they shall shew thee from that place which the LORD shall choose; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they shall teach thee:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the man that doeth presumptuously, in not hearkening unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein; and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are round about me;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, which is not thy brother.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book, out of <span class='add'>that which is </span>before the priests the Levites:   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
