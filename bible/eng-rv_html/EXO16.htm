And Moses said unto them, It is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall ye take it, every man for them which are in his tent.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Moses said unto them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake, and seethe that which ye will seethe; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Moses said, Eat that today; for today is a sabbath unto the LORD: today ye shall not find it in the field.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people for to gather, and they found none.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So the people rested on the seventh day.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers <span class='add'>made </span>with honey.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
