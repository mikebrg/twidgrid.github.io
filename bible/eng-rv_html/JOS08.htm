And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the other came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For Joshua drew not back his hand wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger as the homeborn; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded, that they should bless the people of Israel first of all.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
