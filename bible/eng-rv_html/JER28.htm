And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD: Thou hast broken the bars of wood; but thou shalt make in their stead bars of iron.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; the LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
