And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son: so they went both of them together.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind <span class='add'>him </span>a ram caught in the thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
