Do <span class='add'>men </span>gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out devils, and by thy name do many mighty works?   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Every one therefore which heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, which built his house upon the rock:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon the rock.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And every one that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and smote upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Jesus ended these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>for he taught them as <span class='add'>one </span>having authority, and not as their scribes.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
