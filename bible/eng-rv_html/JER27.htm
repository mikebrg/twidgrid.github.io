  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD’S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a desolation?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels, that are left in this city,   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
