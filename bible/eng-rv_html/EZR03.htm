And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ <span class='add'>houses</span>, the old men that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
