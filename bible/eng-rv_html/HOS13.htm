O grave, where is thy destruction? repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the breath of the LORD coming up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Samaria shall bear her guilt; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
