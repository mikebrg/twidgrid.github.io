And the blood shall be forgiven them.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God delivereth them into thine hands, and thou carriest them away captive,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated, which is the firstborn:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them:   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a riotous liver, and a drunkard.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
