And his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as the homeborn, when he blasphemeth the name <span class='add'>of the LORD</span>, shall be put to death.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good: life for life.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for the homeborn: for I am the LORD your God.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Moses spake to the children of Israel, and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones.
