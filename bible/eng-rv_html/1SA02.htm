And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD’S people to transgress.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If one man sin against another, God shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I reveal myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt <span class='add'>in bondage </span>to Pharaoh’s house?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in <span class='add'>my </span>habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And thou shalt behold the affliction of <span class='add'>my </span>habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the man of thine, <span class='add'>whom </span>I shall not cut off from mine altar, <span class='add'>shall be </span>to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
