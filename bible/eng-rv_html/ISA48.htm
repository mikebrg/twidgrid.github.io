I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou hast not known.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from of old thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou didst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do it; for how should <span class='add'>my name </span>be profaned? and my glory will I not give to another.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Yea, mine hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread out the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm <span class='add'>shall be on </span>the Chaldeans.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD hath sent me, and his spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the LORD thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains thereof: his name should not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
