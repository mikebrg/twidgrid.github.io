So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they asked Baruch, saying, tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and <span class='add'>there was a fire in </span>the brasier burning before him.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that <span class='add'>the king </span>cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brasier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brasier.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD: Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
