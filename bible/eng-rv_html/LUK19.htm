Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he said unto them that stood by, Take away from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I say unto you, that unto every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Howbeit these mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called <span class='add'>the mount </span>of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>saying, Go your way into the village over against <span class='add'>you</span>; in the which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat: loose him, and bring him.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say, The Lord hath need of him.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they that were sent went away, and found even as he had said unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they said, The Lord hath need of him.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And as he was now drawing nigh, <span class='add'>even </span>at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen;   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>saying, Blessed <span class='add'>is </span>the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he answered and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And when he drew nigh, he saw the city and wept over it,   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>saying, If thou hadst known in this day, even thou, the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>For the days shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>and shall dash thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold,   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>saying unto them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him:   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him, listening.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
