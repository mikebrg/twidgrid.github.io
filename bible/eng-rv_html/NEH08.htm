And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people <span class='add'>stood </span>in their place.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Nehemiah, which was the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye grieved; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers’ <span class='add'>houses </span>of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they found written in the law, how that the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according unto the ordinance.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
