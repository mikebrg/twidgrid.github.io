And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words, <span class='add'>even </span>comfortable words.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Cry yet again, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts: My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the LORD shewed me four smiths.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
