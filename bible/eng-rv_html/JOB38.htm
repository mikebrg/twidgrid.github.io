  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who stretched the line upon it?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span><span class='add'>Or who </span>shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, <span class='add'>as if </span>it had issued out of the womb;   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And prescribed for it my decree, and set bars and doors,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days <span class='add'>began, and </span>caused the dayspring to know its place;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>It is changed as clay under the seal; and <span class='add'>all things </span>stand forth as a garment:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm is broken.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Hast thou comprehended the breadth of the earth? declare, if thou knowest it all.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and as for darkness, where is the place thereof;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span><span class='add'>Doubtless</span>, thou knowest, for thou wast then born, and the number of thy days is great!   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>By what way is the light parted, or the east wind scattered upon the earth?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, or a way for the lightning of the thunder;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>To satisfy the waste and desolate <span class='add'>ground</span>; and to cause the tender grass to spring forth?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The waters are hidden as <span class='add'>with </span>stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the mind?   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Who can number the clouds by wisdom? or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>When the dust runneth into a mass, and the clods cleave fast together?   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness? or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>When they couch in their dens, <span class='add'>and </span>abide in the covert to lie in wait?   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Who provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto God, <span class='add'>and </span>wander for lack of meat?
