Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and <span class='add'>that </span>the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <span class='add'>temple </span>ye are.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
