Come ye forth to meet him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Afterward come also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>it is </span>as <span class='add'>when </span>a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In like manner he also that <span class='add'>received </span>the two gained other two.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he also that <span class='add'>received </span>the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in;   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink?   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, <span class='add'>even </span>these least, ye did it unto me.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels:   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
