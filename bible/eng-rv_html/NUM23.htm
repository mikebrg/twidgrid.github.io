And he went to a bare height.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him: Lo, it is a people that dwell alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD putteth in my mouth?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet <span class='add'>the LORD </span>yonder.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>God is not a man, that he should lie; Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and shall he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold, I have received <span class='add'>commandment </span>to bless: And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: The LORD his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>God bringeth them forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob, Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shall it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up: He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
