Herein thou hast done foolishly; for from henceforth thou shalt have wars.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And in the thirty and ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds <span class='add'>of spices </span>prepared by the apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
