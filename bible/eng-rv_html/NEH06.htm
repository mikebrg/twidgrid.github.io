<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in <span class='add'>one of </span>the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: Why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou buildest the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, <span class='add'>O God</span>, strengthen thou my hands.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him: but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <span class='add'>day </span>of <span class='add'>the month </span>Elul, in fifty and two days.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard <span class='add'>thereof</span>, that all the heathen that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <span class='add'>the letters </span>of Tobiah came unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. <span class='add'>And </span>Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
