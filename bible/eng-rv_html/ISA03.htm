Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Say ye of the righteous, that <span class='add'>it shall be </span>well <span class='add'>with him</span>: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Woe unto the wicked! <span class='add'>it shall be </span>ill <span class='add'>with him</span>: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.
