<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: nay indeed bear with me.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you <span class='add'>as </span>a pure virgin to Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or <span class='add'>if </span>ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with <span class='add'>him</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But though <span class='add'>I be </span>rude in speech, yet <span class='add'>am I </span>not in knowledge; nay, in everything we have made <span class='add'>it </span>manifest among all men to you-ward.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I robbed other churches, taking wages <span class='add'>of them </span>that I might minister unto you;   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and <span class='add'>so </span>will I keep <span class='add'>myself</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I say again, Let no man think me foolish; but if <span class='add'>ye do</span>, yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise <span class='add'>yourselves</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you <span class='add'>captive</span>, if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labours more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Of the Jews five times received I forty <span class='add'>stripes </span>save one.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span><span class='add'>in </span>journeyings often, <span class='add'>in </span>perils of rivers, <span class='add'>in </span>perils of robbers, <span class='add'>in </span>perils from <span class='add'>my </span>countrymen, <span class='add'>in </span>perils from the Gentiles, <span class='add'>in </span>perils in the city, <span class='add'>in </span>perils in the wilderness, <span class='add'>in </span>perils in the sea, <span class='add'>in </span>perils among false brethren;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span><span class='add'>in </span>labour and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Beside those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is made to stumble, and I burn not?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes, in order to take me:   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
