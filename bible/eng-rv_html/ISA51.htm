Art thou not it that cut Rahab in pieces, that pierced the dragon?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Art thou not it which dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; that made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy, <span class='add'>and </span>sorrow and sighing shall flee away.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou art afraid of man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and hast forgotten the LORD thy Maker, that stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fearest continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he maketh ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The captive exile shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not die <span class='add'>and go down </span>into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For I am the LORD thy God, which stirreth up the sea, that the waves thereof roar: the LORD of hosts is his name.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>These two things are befallen thee; who shall bemoan thee? desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort thee?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the top of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy back as the ground, and as the street, to them that go over.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
