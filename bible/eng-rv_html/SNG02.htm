I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Stay ye me with raisins, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>His left hand <span class='add'>is </span>under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awaken love, until it please.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh in at the windows, he sheweth himself through the lattice.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing <span class='add'>of birds </span>is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The fig tree ripeneth her green figs, and the vines are in blossom, they give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice: for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth <span class='add'>his flock </span>among the lilies.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
