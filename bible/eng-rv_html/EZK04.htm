This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: <span class='add'>according to </span>the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; <span class='add'>according to </span>the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with carefulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>that they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
