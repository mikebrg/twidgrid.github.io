And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the LORD hearkened unto the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
