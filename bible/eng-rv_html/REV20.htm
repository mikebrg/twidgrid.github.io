This is the first resurrection.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and shall come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was opened, which is <span class='add'>the book </span>of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, <span class='add'>even </span>the lake of fire.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
