I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned one with another, saying, This is the heir: let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But he looked upon them, and said, What then is this that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spake this parable against them.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person <span class='add'>of any</span>, but of a truth teachest the way of God:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? And they said, Caesar’s.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Then render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people: and they marveled at his answer, and held their peace.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, they which say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him,   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, that if a man’s brother die, having a wife, and he be childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless;   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and the second;   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Afterward the woman also died.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Jesus said unto them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage:   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>for neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed, in <span class='add'>the place concerning </span>the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For they durst not any more ask him any question.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he said unto them, How say they that the Christ is David’s son?   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>For David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>David therefore calleth him Lord, and how is he his son?   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples,   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts;   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
