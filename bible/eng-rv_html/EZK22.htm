I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee through the countries; and I will consume thy filthiness out of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thou shalt be profaned in thyself, in the sight of the nations; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross unto me: all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Because ye are all become dross, therefore behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will lay you there, and melt you.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shalt be melted in the midst thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Son of man, say unto her, thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in the midst thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey; to shed blood, <span class='add'>and </span>to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered <span class='add'>mortar</span>, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery; yea, they have vexed the poor and needy, and have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the fence, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I brought upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
