Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, when they cast up mounts and build forts, to cut off many persons.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet hath done all these things; he shall not escape.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of his young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
