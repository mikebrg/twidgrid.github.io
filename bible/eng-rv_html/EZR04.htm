  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
