But I said, I pine away, I pine away, woe is me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth do shake.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The earth is utterly broken, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The earth shall stagger like a drunken man, and shall be moved to and fro like a hut; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
