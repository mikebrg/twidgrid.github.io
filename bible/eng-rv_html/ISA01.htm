</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: <span class='add'>but </span>Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly: they have forsaken the LORD, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged <span class='add'>and gone </span>backward.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; <span class='add'>but </span>wounds, and bruises, and festering sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,—I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>How is the faithful city become an harlot! she that was full of judgment! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and I will turn my hand upon thee, and throughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, the faithful city.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But the destruction of the transgressors and the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
