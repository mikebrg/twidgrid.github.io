</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ <span class='add'>which are </span>at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have toward all the saints,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as <span class='add'>it doth </span>in you also, since the day ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth;   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>even as ye learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For this cause we also, since the day we heard <span class='add'>it</span>, do not cease to pray and make request for you, that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>to walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, unto all patience and longsuffering with joy;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>giving thanks unto the Father, who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>for in him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and unto him;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and he is before all things, and in him all things consist.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For it was the good pleasure <span class='add'>of the Father </span>that in him should all the fulness dwell;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and through him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, <span class='add'>I say</span>, whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And you, being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works, yet now hath he reconciled   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>if so be that ye continue in the faith, grounded and stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a minister.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church;   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>whereof I was made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which was given me to you-ward, to fulfill the word of God,   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span><span class='add'>even </span>the mystery which hath been hid from all ages and generations: but now hath it been manifested to his saints,   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>to whom God was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ;   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>whereunto I labour also, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
