And the LORD heard it.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they three came out.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all mine house:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the form of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the cloud removed from over the Tent; and, behold, Miriam was leprous, as <span class='add'>white as </span>snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Aaron said unto Moses, Oh my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother’s womb.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her, O God, I beseech thee.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Miriam was shut up without the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
