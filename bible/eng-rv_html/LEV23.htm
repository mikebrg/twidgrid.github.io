ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto the LORD in all your dwellings.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>These are the set feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is the LORD’S passover.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the meal offering thereof shall be two tenth parts <span class='add'>of an ephah </span>of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal offering unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth parts <span class='add'>of an ephah</span>: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for firstfruits unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meal offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin offering, and two he-lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day;

and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you;

and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall keep it in the seventh month.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are homeborn in Israel shall dwell in booths:   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of the LORD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
