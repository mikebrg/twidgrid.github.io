<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now concerning spiritual <span class='add'>gifts</span>, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Ye know that when ye were Gentiles <span class='add'>ye were </span>led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits: to another <span class='add'>divers </span>kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the body is not one member, but many.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And if they were all one member, where were the body?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But now they are many members, but one body.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and those <span class='add'>parts </span>of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely <span class='add'>parts </span>have more abundant comeliness;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>whereas our comely <span class='add'>parts </span>have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honour to that <span class='add'>part </span>which lacked;   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>that there should be no schism in the body; but <span class='add'>that </span>the members should have the same care one for another.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or <span class='add'>one </span>member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, <span class='add'>divers </span>kinds of tongues.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all <span class='add'>workers of </span>miracles?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And a still more excellent way shew I unto you.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
