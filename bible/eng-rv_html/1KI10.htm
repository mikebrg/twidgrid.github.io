So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>beside <span class='add'>that which </span>the chapmen <span class='add'>brought</span>, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred <span class='add'>shekels </span>of gold went to one target.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>he made </span>three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred <span class='add'>shekels </span>of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
