 <div class='mt2'>THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF  </div><div class='mt'>JAMES.   
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greeting.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations;   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Knowing that the proof of your faith worketh patience.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And let patience have <span class='add'>its </span>perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord;   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind, and withereth the grass; and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which <span class='add'>the Lord </span>promised to them that love him.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Every good gift and every perfect boon is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Ye know <span class='add'>this</span>, my beloved brethren. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But he that looketh into the perfect law, the <span class='add'>law </span>of liberty, and <span class='add'>so </span>continueth, being not a hearer that forgetteth, but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his doing.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this man’s religion is vain.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, <span class='add'>and </span>to keep himself unspotted from the world.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
