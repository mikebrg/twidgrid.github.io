And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it was so, as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion <span class='add'>of flesh</span>, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And David said unto Michal, <span class='add'>It was </span>before the LORD, which chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will be yet more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
