<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And when David was a little past the top <span class='add'>of the ascent</span>, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came out, and cursed still as he came.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and man of Belial:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art <span class='add'>taken </span>in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more <span class='add'>may </span>this Benjamite now <span class='add'>do it</span>? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It may be that the LORD will look on the wrong done unto me, and that the LORD will requite me good for <span class='add'>his </span>cursing of me this day.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So David and his men went by the way: and Shimei went along on the hill side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And again, whom should I serve? <span class='add'>should I </span>not <span class='add'>serve </span>in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
