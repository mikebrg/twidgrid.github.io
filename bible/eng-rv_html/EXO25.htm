gold, and silver, and brass;   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ <span class='add'>hair</span>;   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and rams’ skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense;   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>According to all that I shew thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they shall make an ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou shalt make staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And thou shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark withal.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And thou shalt make a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half <span class='add'>shall be </span>the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And thou shalt make a table of acacia wood: two cubits <span class='add'>shall be </span>the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And thou shalt make unto it a border of an handbreadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Close by the border shall the rings be, for places for the staves to bear the table.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the flagons thereof, and the bowls thereof, to pour out withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it:   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>and there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick:   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>and in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof:   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Their knops and their branches shall be of one piece with it: the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And thou shalt make the lamps thereof, seven: and they shall light the lamps thereof, to give light over against it.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made, with all these vessels.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And see that thou make them after their pattern, which hath been shewed thee in the mount.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
