And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon today?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a sojourner in a strange land.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge <span class='add'>of them</span>.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
