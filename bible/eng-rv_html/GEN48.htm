And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near unto him.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which hath fed me all my life long unto this day,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>the angel which hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And his father refused, and said, I know <span class='add'>it</span>, my son, I know <span class='add'>it</span>: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
