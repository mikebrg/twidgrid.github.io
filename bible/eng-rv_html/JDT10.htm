And she worshipped God,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and said unto them, Command that they open unto me the gate of the city, and I will go forth to accomplish the things whereof ye spake with me. And they commanded the young men to open unto her, as she had spoken:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and they did so.  </div><div class='p'>And Judith went out, she, and her handmaid with her; and the men of the city looked after her, until she was gone down the mountain, until she had passed the valley, and they could see her no more.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they went straight onward in the valley: and the watch of the Assyrians met her;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and they took her, and asked her, Of what people art thou? and whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am a daughter of the Hebrews, and I flee away from their presence; because they are about to be given you to be consumed:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and I am coming into the presence of Holofernes the chief captain of your host, to declare words of truth; and I will shew before him a way, whereby he shall go, and win all the hill country, and there shall not be lacking of his men one person, nor one life.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now when the men heard her words, and considered her countenance, the beauty thereof was exceeding marvellous in their eyes, and they said unto her,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou hast saved thy life, in that thou hast hasted to come down to the presence of our lord: and now come to his tent, and some of us shall conduct thee, until they shall deliver thee into his hands.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Gr. if. </span></a> when thou standest before him, be not afraid in thine heart, but declare unto him according to thy words; and he shall entreat thee well.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they chose out of them a hundred men, and appointed them to accompany her and her maid; and they brought them to the tent of Holofernes.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And there was a concourse throughout all the camp, for her coming was noised among the tents; and they came and compassed her about, as she stood without the tent of Holofernes, until they told him of her.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they marvelled at her beauty, and marvelled at the children of Israel because of her, and each one said to his neighbour, Who shall despise this people, that have among them such women? for it is not good that one man of them be left, seeing that, if they are let go, they shall be able to deceive the whole earth.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they that lay near Holofernes, and all his servants, went forth and brought her into the tent.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Holofernes was resting upon his bed under the canopy, which was woven with purple and gold and emeralds and precious stones.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they told him of her; and he came forth into the space before his tent, with silver lamps going before him.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But when Judith was come before him and his servants, they all marvelled at the beauty of her countenance; and she fell down upon her face, and did reverence unto him: and his servants raised her up.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
