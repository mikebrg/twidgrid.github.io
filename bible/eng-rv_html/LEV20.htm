he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to death:   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the soul that turneth unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto the wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his father’s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, nor of thy father’s sister: for he hath made naked his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle’s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from the peoples.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Ye shall therefore separate between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any thing wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have separated from you as unclean.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have separated you from the peoples, that ye should be mine.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
