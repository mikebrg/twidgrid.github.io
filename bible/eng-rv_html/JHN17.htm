Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we <span class='add'>are</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil <span class='add'>one</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, <span class='add'>art </span>in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we <span class='add'>are </span>one;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Father, that which thou hast given me, I will that, where I am, they also may be with me; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
