And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Gideon saw that he was the angel of the LORD; and Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! forasmuch as I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father’s bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this strong hold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had spoken unto him: and it came to pass, because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? or will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst <span class='add'>it is yet </span>morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath broken down his altar.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath broken down his altar.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But the spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after him.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast spoken,   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast spoken.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
