And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan;   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the hinder sea;   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face;   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>in all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
