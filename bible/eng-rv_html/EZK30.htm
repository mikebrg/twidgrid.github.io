  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a day of clouds; it shall be the time of the heathen.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Thus saith the LORD: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Noph; and there shall be no more a prince out of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strong hold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will set a fire in Egypt; Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up: and Noph <span class='add'>shall have </span>adversaries in the day time.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword: and these <span class='add'>cities </span>shall go into captivity.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first <span class='add'>month</span>, in the seventh <span class='add'>day </span>of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up to apply <span class='add'>healing </span>medicines, to put a roller to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
