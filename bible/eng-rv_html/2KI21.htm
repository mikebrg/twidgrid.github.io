  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and he forsook the LORD, the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
