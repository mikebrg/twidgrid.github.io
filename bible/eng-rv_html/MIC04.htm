Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon; there shalt thou be rescued; there shall the LORD redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see <span class='add'>its desire </span>upon Zion.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshingfloor.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and thou shalt devote their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
