The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the sea coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed <span class='add'>their flocks </span>thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for the LORD their God shall visit them, and bring again their captivity.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the chapiters thereof: <span class='add'>their </span>voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he hath laid bare the cedar work.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none else beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
