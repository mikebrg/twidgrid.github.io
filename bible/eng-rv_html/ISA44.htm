Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no Rock; I know not any.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit: and their own witnesses see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who hath fashioned a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed; and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; they shall fear, they shall be ashamed together.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The smith <span class='add'>maketh </span>an axe, and worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with his strong arm: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth; he drinketh no water, and is faint.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The carpenter stretcheth out a line; he marketh it out with a pencil; he shapeth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compasses, and shapeth it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in the house.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the holm tree and the oak, and strengtheneth for himself one among the trees of the forest: he planteth a fir tree, and the rain doth nourish it.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then shall it be for a man to burn; and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread: yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it and worshippeth, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They know not, neither do they consider: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And none calleth to mind, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Remember these things, O Jacob; and Israel, for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Sing, O ye heavens, for the LORD hath done it; shout, ye lower parts of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb: I am the LORD, that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth; who is with me?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>that frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>that confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith of Jerusalem, She shall be inhabited; and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places thereof:   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>that saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>That saith of Cyrus, <span class='add'>He is </span>my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying of Jerusalem, She shall be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
