Moreover the LORD telleth thee that the LORD will make thee an house.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>but my mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thine house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then David the king went in, and sat before the LORD; and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of men, O Lord GOD!   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee out of Egypt, <span class='add'>from </span>the nations and their gods?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is God over Israel: and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For thou, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And now, O Lord GOD, thou art God, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
