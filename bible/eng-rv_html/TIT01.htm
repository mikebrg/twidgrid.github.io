For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
