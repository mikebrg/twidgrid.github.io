These things teach and exhort.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If any man teacheth a different doctrine, and consenteth not to sound words, <span class='add'>even </span>the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but doting about questionings and disputes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But godliness with contentment is great gain:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>for we brought nothing into the world, for neither can we carry anything out;   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>but having food and covering we shall be therewith content.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But they that desire to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou wast called, and didst confess the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I charge thee in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>that thou keep the commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>which in its own times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom <span class='add'>be </span>honour and power eternal. Amen.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Charge them that are rich in this present world, that they be not highminded, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life which is <span class='add'>life </span>indeed.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>O Timothy, guard that which is committed unto <span class='add'>thee</span>, turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>which some professing have erred concerning the faith.
