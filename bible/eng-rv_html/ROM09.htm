<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Ghost,   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren’s sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh:   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service <span class='add'>of God</span>, and the promises;   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But <span class='add'>it is </span>not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, <span class='add'>even </span>by our father Isaac—   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>for <span class='add'>the children </span>being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth,   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might shew in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span><span class='add'>even </span>us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>As he saith also in Hosea, I will call that my people, which was not my people; And her beloved, which was not beloved.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And it shall be, <span class='add'>that </span>in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, There shall they be called sons of the living God.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>for the Lord will execute <span class='add'>his </span>word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And, as Isaiah hath said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at <span class='add'>that </span>law.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Wherefore? Because <span class='add'>they sought it </span>not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>even as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
