This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders thereof round about, according to their families.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and Chephar-ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah;   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite (the same is Jerusalem), Gibeath, <span class='add'>and </span>Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages.
