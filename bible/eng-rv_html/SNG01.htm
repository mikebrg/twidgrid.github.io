My mother’s sons were incensed against me, they made me keeper of the vineyards; <span class='add'>but </span>mine own vineyard have I not kept.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest <span class='add'>thy flock</span>, where thou makest <span class='add'>it </span>to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that is veiled beside the flocks of thy companions?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I have compared thee, O my love, to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thy cheeks are comely with plaits <span class='add'>of hair</span>, thy neck with strings of jewels   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>We will make thee plaits of gold with studs of silver.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>While the king sat at his table, my spikenard sent forth its fragrance.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>My beloved is unto me <span class='add'>as </span>a bundle of myrrh, that lieth betwixt my breasts.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>My beloved is unto me <span class='add'>as </span>a cluster of henna-flowers in the vineyards of En-gedi.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are <span class='add'>as </span>doves.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our couch is green.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The beams of our house are cedars, <span class='add'>and </span>our rafters are firs.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
