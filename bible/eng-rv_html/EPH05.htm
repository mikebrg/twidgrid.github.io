He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>because we are members of his body.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the twain shall become one flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and <span class='add'>let </span>the wife <span class='add'>see </span>that she fear her husband.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
