<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And as they spake unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and Annas the high priest <span class='add'>was there</span>, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <span class='add'>even </span>in him doth this man stand here before you whole.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And seeing the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>who by the Holy Ghost, <span class='add'>by </span>the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say, Why did the Gentiles rage, And the peoples imagine vain things?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together, Against the Lord, and against his Anointed:   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel foreordained to come to pass.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one <span class='add'>of them </span>said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>and laid them at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>having a field, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
