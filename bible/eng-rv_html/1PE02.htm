Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Servants, <span class='add'>be </span>in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted <span class='add'>for it</span>, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer <span class='add'>for it</span>, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not; but committed <span class='add'>himself </span>to him that judgeth righteously:   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
