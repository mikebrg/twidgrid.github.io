A city set on a hill cannot be hid.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Neither do <span class='add'>men </span>light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Even so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfill.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed <span class='add'>the righteousness </span>of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the last farthing.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>but I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God;   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil <span class='add'>one</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him twain.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy:   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>but I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you;   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>that ye may be sons of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more <span class='add'>than others</span>? do not even the Gentiles the same?   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
