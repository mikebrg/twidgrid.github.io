Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For if we have become united with <span class='add'>him </span>by the likeness of his death, we shall be also <span class='add'>by the likeness </span>of his resurrection;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <span class='add'>him</span>, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin;   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>for he that hath died is justified from sin.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>neither present your members unto sin <span class='add'>as </span>instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members <span class='add'>as </span>instruments of righteousness unto God.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves <span class='add'>as </span>servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members <span class='add'>as </span>servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members <span class='add'>as </span>servants to righteousness unto sanctification.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
