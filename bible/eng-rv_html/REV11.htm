And they went up into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The second Woe is past: behold, the third Woe cometh quickly.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the seventh angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, The kingdom of the world is become <span class='add'>the kingdom </span>of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the four and twenty elders, which sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God,   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, which art and which wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and <span class='add'>the time </span>to give their reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven; and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
