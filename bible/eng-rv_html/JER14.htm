We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold dismay!   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Do not abhor <span class='add'>us</span>, for thy name’s sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Are there any among the vanities of the heathen that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee; for thou hast made all these things.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
