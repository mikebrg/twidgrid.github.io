Behold, this is the law of the house.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And these are the measures of the altar by cubits: (the cubit is a cubit and an handbreadth:) the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span: and this shall be the base of the altar.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the altar hearth shall be twelve <span class='add'>cubits </span>long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the settle shall be fourteen <span class='add'>cubits </span>long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and the steps thereof shall look toward the east.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And thou shalt bring them near before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
