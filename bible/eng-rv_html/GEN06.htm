Noah was a righteous man, <span class='add'>and </span>perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; every thing that is in the earth shall die.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Of the fowl after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
