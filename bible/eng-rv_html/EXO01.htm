And they built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigour.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birthstool; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
