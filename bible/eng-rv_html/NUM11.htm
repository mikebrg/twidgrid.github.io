  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all: we have nought save this manna to look to.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and seethed it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou evil entreated thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have rejected the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD’S hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the LORD came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent: and they prophesied in the camp.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would God that all the LORD’S people were prophets, that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
