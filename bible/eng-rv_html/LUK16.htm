<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And calling to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <span class='add'>riches</span>?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The law and the prophets <span class='add'>were </span>until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and desiring to be fed with the <span class='add'>crumbs </span>that fell from the rich man’s table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou art in anguish.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they which would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house;   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
