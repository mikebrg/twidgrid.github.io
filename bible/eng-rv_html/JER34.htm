for I have spoken the word, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>when the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these <span class='add'>alone </span>remained of the cities of Judah <span class='add'>as </span>fenced cities.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>that every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, <span class='add'>to wit</span>, of a Jew his brother:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And all the princes and all the people obeyed, which had entered into the covenant, that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids:   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in mine eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>but ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and ye brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD: Ye have not hearkened unto me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim unto you a liberty, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are gone up from you.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
