The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the porch that was before <span class='add'>the house</span>, the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm trees and chains:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he made the most holy house; the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one <span class='add'>cherub </span>was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was <span class='add'>likewise </span>five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits <span class='add'>also</span>, joining to the wing of the other cherub.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Also he made before the house two pillars, of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he made chains in the oracle, and put <span class='add'>them </span>on the tops of the pillars; and he made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
