Then they brought these men before the king.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, <span class='add'>well</span>: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If it be <span class='add'>so</span>, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: <span class='add'>therefore </span>he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he commanded certain mighty men that were in is army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, <span class='add'>and </span>to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their <span class='add'>other </span>garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth out of the midst of the fire.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dung-hill: because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
