And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething caldron; and the face thereof is from the north.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness; in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
