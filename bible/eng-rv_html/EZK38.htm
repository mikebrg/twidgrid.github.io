hast thou assembled thy company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD: In that day when my people Israel dwelleth securely, shalt thou not know it?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses; a great company and a mighty army:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and thou shalt come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD: Art thou he of whom I spake in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days for <span class='add'>many </span>years that I would bring thee against them?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up into my nostrils.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>so that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I will call for a sword against him unto all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man’s sword shall be against his brother.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood: and I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am the LORD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
