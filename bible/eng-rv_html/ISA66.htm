Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I that cause to bring forth shut <span class='add'>the womb</span>? saith thy God.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream, and ye shall suck <span class='add'>thereof</span>; ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And ye shall see <span class='add'>it</span>, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and he will have indignation against his enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For by fire will the LORD plead, and by his sword, with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves <span class='add'>to go </span>unto the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse; they shall come to an end together, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For I <span class='add'>know </span>their works and their thoughts: <span class='add'>the time </span>cometh, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an offering unto the LORD, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And of them also will I take for priests <span class='add'>and </span>for Levites, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
