and thy name is glorified for evermore:   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done: yea, true are all thy works, and thy ways are right, and all thy judgements truth.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, <span class='add'>even </span> Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgements: for according to truth and justice hast thou brought all these things upon us because of our sins.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For we have sinned and committed iniquity, in departing from thee.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and everything that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgement.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, and most hateful forsakers <span class='add'>of God, </span> and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And now we cannot open our mouth;
