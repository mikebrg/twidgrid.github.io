And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>from </span>many of those which had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And there was much joy in that city.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But there was a certain man, Simon by name, which beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>for as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem for to worship;   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Now the place of the scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth:   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For his life is taken from the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other?   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, <span class='add'>here is </span>water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Some ancient authorities insert, wholly or in part, ver. 37 And Phillip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest.
