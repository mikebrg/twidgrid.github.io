</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way;   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and <span class='add'>had </span>a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Now after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea: for they were fishers.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And going on a little further, he saw James the <span class='add'>son </span>of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>saying, What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with devils.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And all the city was gathered together at the door.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and he suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out devils.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
