  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Symeon hath rehearsed how first God did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>After these things I will return, And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen; And I will build again the ruins thereof, And I will set it up:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from the beginning of the world.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles turn to God;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; <span class='add'>namely</span>, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and they wrote <span class='add'>thus </span>by them, The apostles and the elder brethren unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment;   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And after they had spent some time <span class='add'>there</span>, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Some ancient authorities insert, with variations, ver. 34 But it seemed good unto Silas to abide there.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, <span class='add'>and see </span>how they fare.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus;   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>but Paul chose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
