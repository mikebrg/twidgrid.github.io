<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel:   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and as they were affrighted, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they remembered his words,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the <span class='add'>mother </span>of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But we hoped that it was he which should redeem Israel. Yea and beside all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Behoved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they rehearsed the things <span class='add'>that happened </span>in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace <span class='add'>be </span>unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do reasonings arise in your heart?   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and his feet.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And he took it, and did eat before them.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, how that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Ye are witnesses of these things.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And he led them out until <span class='add'>they were </span>over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>and were continually in the temple, blessing God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
