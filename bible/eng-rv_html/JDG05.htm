<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For that the leaders took the lead in Israel, for that the people offered themselves willingly, bless ye the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, <span class='add'>even </span>I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>LORD, when thou wentest forth out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, yea, the clouds dropped water.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The mountains flowed down at the presence of the LORD, even yon Sinai at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people: bless ye the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Tell <span class='add'>of it</span>, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit on rich carpets, and ye that walk by the way.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, <span class='add'>even </span>the righteous acts of his rule in Israel. Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then came down a remnant of the nobles <span class='add'>and </span>the people; the LORD came down for me against the mighty.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Out of Ephraim <span class='add'>came down </span>they whose root is in Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal’s staff.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; as was Issachar, so was Barak; into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben there were great resolves of heart.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Why satest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the pipings for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and abode by his creeks.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death, and Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The kings came and fought; then fought the kings of Canaan; in Taanach by the waters of Meggido: they took no gain of money.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They fought from heaven, the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The river Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then did the horsehoofs stamp by reason of the pransings, the pransings of their strong ones.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Blessed above women shall Jael be, the wife of Heber the Kenite, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He asked water, <span class='add'>and </span>she gave him milk; she brought him butter in a lordly dish.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head, yea, she pierced and struck through his temples.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Through the window she looked forth, and cried, the mother of Sisera <span class='add'>cried </span>through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil? a damsel, two damsels to every man; to Sisera a spoil of divers colours, a spoil of divers colours of embroidery, of divers colours of embroidery on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So let all thine enemies perish, <span class='add'>O LORD</span>: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
