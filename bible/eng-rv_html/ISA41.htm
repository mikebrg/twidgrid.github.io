I the LORD, the first, and with the last, I am he.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The isles saw, and feared; the ends of the earth trembled: they drew near, and came.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They helped every one his neighbour; and <span class='add'>every one </span>said to his brother, Be of good courage.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smiteth the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But thou, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend;   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>thou whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the corners thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee and not cast thee away;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Behold, all they that are incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they that strive with thee shall be as nothing, and shall perish.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contend with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, thou shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The poor and needy seek water and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst; I the LORD will answer them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let them bring them forth, and declare unto us what shall happen: declare ye the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or shew us things for to come.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination is he that chooseth you.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I have raised up one from the north, and he is come; from the rising of the sun one that calleth upon my name: and he shall come upon rulers as upon mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Who hath declared it from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, <span class='add'>He is </span>righteous? yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that heareth your words.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span><span class='add'>I </span>first <span class='add'>will say </span>unto Zion, Behold, behold them; and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And when I look, there is no man; even among them there is no counsellor, that, when I ask of them, can answer a word.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Behold, all of them, their works are vanity <span class='add'>and </span>nought: their molten images are wind and confusion.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
