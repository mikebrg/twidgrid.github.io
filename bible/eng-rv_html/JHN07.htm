If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For even his brethren did not believe on him.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is alway ready.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And having said these things unto them, he abode <span class='add'>still </span>in Galilee.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it be of God, or <span class='add'>whether </span>I speak from myself.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Did not Moses give you the law, and <span class='add'>yet </span>none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The multitude answered, Thou hast a devil: who seeketh to kill thee?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For this cause hath Moses given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come?   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Now on the last day, the great <span class='add'>day </span>of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet <span class='add'>given</span>; because Jesus was not yet glorified.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span><span class='add'>Some </span>of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>The officers answered, Never man so spake.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>But this multitude which knoweth not the law are accursed.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>[And they went every man unto his own house:   </div><ul class='tnav'>
