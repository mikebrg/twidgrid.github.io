Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, stablish, strengthen you.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>To him <span class='add'>be </span>the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account <span class='add'>him</span>, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God: stand ye fast therein.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>She that is in Babylon, elect together with <span class='add'>you</span>, saluteth you; and <span class='add'>so doth </span>Mark my son.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Salute one another with a kiss of love.
