Be at peace among yourselves.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but alway follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Rejoice alway;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>pray without ceasing;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Quench not the Spirit;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>despise not prophesyings;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>prove all things; hold fast that which is good;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>abstain from every form of evil.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Brethren, pray for us.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
