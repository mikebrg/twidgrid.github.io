Woe for the earth and for the sea: because the devil is gone down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man <span class='add'>child</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the dragon waxed wroth with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus:   </div><ul class='tnav'>
