So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria, unto this day.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So they feared the LORD, and made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>with whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>but the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and unto him shall ye bow yourselves, and to him shall ye sacrifice:   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods:   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>and the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods:   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>but the LORD your God shall ye fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images; their children likewise, and their children’s children, as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
