And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said, Let him be; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke <span class='add'>the LORD </span>to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, upon the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them; and he returned to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover kept to the LORD in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Moreover them that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of everyone according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-necoh.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
