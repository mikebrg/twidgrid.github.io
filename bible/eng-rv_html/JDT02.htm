and the number of horses with their riders twelve thousand:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and thou shalt go forth against all the west country, because they disobeyed the commandment of my mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thou shalt declare unto them, that they prepare earth and water; because I will go forth in my wrath against them, and will cover the whole face of the earth with the feet of my host, and I will give them for a spoil unto them:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and their slain shall fill their valleys and brooks, and the river shall be filled with their dead, till it overflow:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and I will lead them captives to the utmost parts of all the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But thou shalt go forth, and take beforehand for me all their coasts; and <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Gr. they shall yield...and thou shalt reserve.</span></a> if they shall yield themselves unto thee, then shalt thou reserve them for me till the day of their reproof.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But as for them that are disobedient, thine eye shall not spare; but thou shalt give them up to be slain and to be spoiled in all thy land.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, I have spoken, and I will do this with my hand.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou, moreover, shalt not transgress aught of the commandments of thy lord, but thou shalt surely accomplish them, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt not defer to do them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Holofernes went forth from the presence of his lord, and called all the governors and the captains and officers of the host of Asshur;

and sheep and oxen and goats without number for their provision;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and great store of victual for every man, and exceeding much gold and silver out of the king’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he went forth, he and all his host, on their journey, to go before king Nebuchadnezzar, and to cover all the face of the earth westward with their chariots and horsemen and chosen footmen.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And a great company of sundry nations went forth with them like locusts, and like the sand of the earth: for they could not be numbered by reason of their multitude.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they departed out of Nineveh three days’ journey toward the plain of Bectileth, and encamped from Bectileth near the mountain which is at the left hand of the upper Cilicia.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he took all his host, his footmen and horsemen and chariots, and went away from thence into the hill country,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and destroyed Put and Lud, and spoiled all the children of Rasses, and the children of Ishmael, which were over against the wilderness to the south of the land of the Chellians.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he went over Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia, and brake down all the high cities that were upon the river Arbonai, until thou comest to the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he took possession of the borders of Cilicia, and slew all that resisted him, and came unto the borders of Japheth, which were toward the south, over against Arabia.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he compassed about all the children of Midian, and set on fire their tents, and spoiled their sheepcotes.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he went down into the plain of Damascus in the days of wheat harvest, and set on fire all their fields, and utterly destroyed their flocks and herds, and spoiled their cities, and laid their plains waste, and smote all their young men with the edge of the sword.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the fear and the dread of him fell upon them that dwelt on the sea coast, upon them that were in Sidon and Tyre, and them that dwelt in Sur and Ocina, and all that dwelt in Jemnaan;
