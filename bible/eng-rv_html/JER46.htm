<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 46</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Wherefore have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward; and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: terror is on every side, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled, and fallen.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Who is this that riseth up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Egypt riseth up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers: and he saith, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Go up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, that handle the shield; and the Ludim, that handle and bend the bow.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For that day is <span class='add'>a day </span>of the Lord, the LORD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood: for the Lord, the LORD of hosts, hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain dost thou use many medicines; there is no healing for thee.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The nations have heard of thy shame, and the earth is full of thy cry: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, stand forth, and prepare thee; for the sword hath devoured round about thee.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Why are thy strong ones swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He made many to stumble, yea, they fell one upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath let the appointed time pass by.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>O thou daughter that dwellest in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Egypt is a very fair heifer; <span class='add'>but </span>destruction out of the north is come, it is come.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they did not stand: for the day of their calamity is come upon them, the time of their visitation.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The sound thereof shall go like the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and them that trust in him:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, low, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD; for I am with thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee with judgment, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
