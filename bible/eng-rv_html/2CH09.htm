So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>beside that which the chapmen and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred <span class='add'>shekels </span>of beaten gold went to one target.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>he made </span>three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred <span class='add'>shekels </span>of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they brought very man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he ruled over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
