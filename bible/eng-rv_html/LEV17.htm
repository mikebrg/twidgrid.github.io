This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from his people.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood; I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, which taketh in hunting any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is <span class='add'>all one </span>with the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be homeborn or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
