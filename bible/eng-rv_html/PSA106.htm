<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 106</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy <span class='add'>endureth </span>for ever.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD, or shew forth all his praise?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people; O visit me with thy salvation:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the waters covered their adversaries: there was not one of them left.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They envied Moses also in the camp, <span class='add'>and </span>Aaron the saint of the LORD.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped a molten image.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thus they changed their glory for the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, <span class='add'>and </span>terrible things by the Red Sea.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy <span class='add'>them</span>.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore he lifted up his hand unto them, that he would overthrow them in the wilderness:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; and the plague brake in upon them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And that was counted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for evermore.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Because they were rebellious against his spirit, and he spake unadvisedly with his lips.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And they served their idols; which became a snare unto them:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Thus were they defiled with their works, and went a whoring in their doings.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Many times did he deliver them; but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Blessed be the LORD, the God or Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
