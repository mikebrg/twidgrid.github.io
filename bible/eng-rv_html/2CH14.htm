So they built and prospered.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: an these were mighty men of valour.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, there is none beside thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O LORD our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they smote all the cities round shout Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
