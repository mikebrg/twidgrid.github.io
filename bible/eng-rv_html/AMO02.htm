Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Behold, I will press <span class='add'>you </span>in your place, as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver <span class='add'>himself</span>: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
