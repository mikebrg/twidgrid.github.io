they are unclean unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcases ye shall have in abomination.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And these ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier eagle, and the ospray;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and the kite, and the falcon after its kind;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>every raven after its kind;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and the ostrich, and the night hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>All winged creeping things that go upon all four are an abomination unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>even these of them ye may eat; the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And by these ye shall become unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And whosoever beareth <span class='add'>aught </span>of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Every beast which parteth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all four, they are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>All food <span class='add'>therein </span>which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every <span class='add'>such </span>vessel shall be unclean.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And every thing whereupon <span class='add'>any part </span>of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And if <span class='add'>aught </span>of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But if water be put upon the seed, and <span class='add'>aught </span>of their carcase fall thereon, it is unclean unto you.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>For I am the LORD your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>For I am the LORD that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>This is the law of the beast, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
