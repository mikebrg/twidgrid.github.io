<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When therefore the Lord knew how that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he must needs pass through Samaria.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know: for salvation is from the Jews.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (which is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am <span class='add'>he</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And upon this came his disciples; and they marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the men,   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Come, see a man, which told me all things that <span class='add'>ever </span>I did: can this be the Christ?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They went out of the city, and were coming to him.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him <span class='add'>aught </span>to eat?   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <span class='add'>then </span>cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not laboured: others have laboured, and ye are entered into their labour.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that <span class='add'>ever </span>I did.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And many more believed because of his word;   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought <span class='add'>him </span>that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>So the father knew that <span class='add'>it was </span>at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.   <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
