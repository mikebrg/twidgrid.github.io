The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The king spake and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, <span class='add'>saying</span>, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: the kingdom is departed from thee.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>and thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles’ <span class='add'>feathers</span>, and his nails like birds’ <span class='add'>claws</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation:   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
