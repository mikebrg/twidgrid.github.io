Be strong and of a good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God giveth you rest, and will give you this land.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and shall help them;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as <span class='add'>he hath given </span>you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond Jordan toward the sunrising.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
