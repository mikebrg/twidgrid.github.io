Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All that openeth the womb is mine; and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of ox and sheep.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, <span class='add'>even </span>of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before the LORD thy God three times in the year.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The first of the firstfruits of thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses spake to them.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded;   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
