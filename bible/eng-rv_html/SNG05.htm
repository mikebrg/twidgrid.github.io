Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I was asleep, but my heart waked: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>My beloved put in his hand by the hole <span class='add'>of the door</span>, and my heart was moved for him.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, <span class='add'>and </span>was gone. My soul had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The watchmen that go about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What is thy beloved more than <span class='add'>another </span>beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than <span class='add'>another </span>beloved, that thou dost so adjure us?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>His head is <span class='add'>as </span>the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, <span class='add'>and </span>black as a raven.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks; washed with milk, <span class='add'>and </span>fitly set.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as banks of sweet herbs: his lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>His hands are <span class='add'>as </span>rings of gold set with beryl: his body is <span class='add'>as </span>ivory work overlaid <span class='add'>with </span>sapphires.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>His legs are <span class='add'>as </span>pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
