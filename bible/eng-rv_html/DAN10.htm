And when he spake unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
