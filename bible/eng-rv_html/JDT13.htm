And Judith, standing by his bed, said in her heart, O Lord God of all power, look in this hour upon the works of my hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For now is the time to help thine inheritance, and to do the thing that I have purposed to the destruction of the enemies which are risen up against us.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And she came to the rail of the bed, which was at Holofernes’ head, and took down his scimitar from thence;   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And she drew near unto the bed, and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And she smote twice upon his neck with all her might, and took away his head from him,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and tumbled his body down from the bed, and took down the canopy from the pillars; and after a little while she went forth, and gave Holofernes’ head to her maid;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and she put it in her bag of victuals: and they twain went forth together unto prayer, according to their custom: and they passed through the camp, and compassed that valley, and went up to the mountain of Bethulia, and came to the gates thereof.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Judith said afar off to the watchmen at the gates, Open, open now the gate: God is with us, even our God, to shew his power yet in Israel, and his might against the enemy, as he hath done even this day.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the men of her city heard her voice, they made haste to go down to the gate of their city, and they called together the elders of the city.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they ran all together, both small and great, for it was strange unto them that she was come: and they opened the gate, and received them, making a fire to give light, and compassed them round about.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And she said to them with a loud voice, Praise God, praise him: praise God, who hath not taken away his mercy from the house of Israel, but hath destroyed our enemies by my hand this night.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And she took forth the head out of the bag, and shewed it, and said unto them, Behold, the head of Holofernes, the chief captain of the host of Asshur, and behold, the canopy, wherein he did lie in his drunkenness; and the Lord smote him by the hand of a woman.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And as the Lord liveth, who preserved me in my way that I went, my countenance deceived him to his destruction, and he did not commit sin with me, to defile and shame me.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And all the people were exceedingly amazed, and bowed themselves, and worshipped God, and said with one accord, Blessed art thou, O our God, which hast this day brought to nought the enemies of thy people.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Ozias said unto her, Blessed art thou, daughter, in the sight of the Most High God, above all the women upon the earth; and blessed is the Lord God, who created the heavens and the earth, who directed thee to the smiting of the head of the prince of our enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For thy hope shall not depart from the heart of men that remember the strength of God for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And God turn these things to thee for a perpetual praise, to visit thee with good things, because thou didst not spare thy life by reason of the affliction of our race, but didst avenge our fall, walking a straight way before our God. And all the people said, So be it, so be it.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
