And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain did burn with fire, that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Oh that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Go say to them, Return ye to your tents.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Ye shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
