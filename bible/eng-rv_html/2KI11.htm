Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, treason.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and him that followeth her slay with the sword: for the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses’ entry to the king’s house: and there was she slain.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD’S people; between the king also and the people.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and brake it down: his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard unto the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword at the king’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
