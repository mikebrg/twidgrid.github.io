  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For he hath said, it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Who gave him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If he set his heart upon man, <span class='add'>if </span>he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If now <span class='add'>thou hast </span>understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Shall even one that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is just <span class='add'>and </span>mighty?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Is it <span class='add'>fit </span>to say to a king, <span class='add'>Thou art </span>vile? <span class='add'>or </span>to nobles, <span class='add'>Ye are </span>wicked?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span><span class='add'>How much less to </span>him that respecteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In a moment they die, even at midnight; the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away without hand.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, and he seeth all his goings.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For he needeth not further to consider a man, that he should go before God in judgment.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He breaketh in pieces mighty men <span class='add'>in ways </span>past finding out, and setteth others in their stead.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Because they turned aside from following him, and would not have regard to any of his ways:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether <span class='add'>it be done </span>unto a nation, or unto a man, alike:   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>That the godless man reign not, that there be none to ensnare the people.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For hath any said unto God, I have borne <span class='add'>chastisement</span>, I will not offend <span class='add'>any more</span>:   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Shall his recompence be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? for thou must choose, and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Men of understanding will say unto me, yea, every wise man that heareth me:   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Job speaketh without knowledge, and his words are without wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Would that Job were tried unto the end, because of his answering like wicked men.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
