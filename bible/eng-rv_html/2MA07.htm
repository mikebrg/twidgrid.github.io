And as the vapour of the pan spread far, they and their mother also exhorted one another to die nobly, saying thus:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The Lord God beholdeth, and in truth is <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Or, comforted in </span></a> intreated for us, as Moses declared in <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">See Deut. xxxi. 21 and xxxii. 36. </span></a> his song, which witnesseth against <span class='add'>the people </span> to their faces, saying, And he shall be <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup">Or, comforted in </span></a> intreated for his servants.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when the first had died after this manner, they brought the second to the mocking; and they pulled off the skin of his head with the hair and asked him, Wilt thou eat, before thy body be punished in every limb?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But he answered in the language of his fathers and said to them, No. Wherefore he also underwent the next torture in succession, as the first had done.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when he was at the last gasp, he said, Thou, miscreant, dost release us out of this present life, but the King of the world shall raise up us, who have died for his laws, unto an eternal renewal of life.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And after him was the third made a mocking-stock. And when he was required, he quickly put out his tongue, and stretched forth his hands courageously,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and nobly said, From heaven I possess these; and for his laws’ sake I contemn these; and from him I hope to receive these back again:   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>insomuch that the king himself and they that were with him were astonished at the young man’s soul, for that he nothing regarded the pains.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when he too was dead, they shamefully handled and tortured the fourth in like manner.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And being come near unto death he said thus: It is good to die at the hands of men and look for the hopes which are <span class='add'>given </span> by God, that we shall be raised up again by him; for as for thee, thou shalt have no resurrection unto life.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And next after him they brought the fifth, and shamefully handled him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But he looked toward <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup">Gr. him. </span></a> the king and said, Because thou hast authority among men, though thou art <span class='add'>thyself </span> corruptible, thou doest what thou wilt; yet think not that our race hath been forsaken of God;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>but hold thou on thy way, and behold his sovereign majesty, how it will torture thee and thy seed.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And after him they brought the sixth. And when he was at the point to die he said, Be not vainly deceived, for we suffer these things for our own doings, as sinning against our own God: marvellous things are come to pass;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>but think not thou that thou shalt be unpunished, having assayed to fight against God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But above all was the mother marvellous and worthy of honourable memory; for when she looked on seven sons perishing within the space of one day, she bare <span class='add'>the sight </span> with a good courage for the hopes <span class='add'>that she had set </span> on the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And she exhorted each one of them in the language of their fathers, filled with a noble temper and stirring up her womanish thought with manly passion, saying unto them,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I know not how ye came into my womb, neither was it I that bestowed on you your <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup">Or, breath </span></a> spirit and your life, and it was not I that brought into order the first elements of each one of you.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore the Creator of the world, who fashioned the <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup">Or, first origin </span></a> generation of man and devised the <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup">Or, first origin </span></a> generation of all things, in mercy giveth back to you again both your <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup">Or, breath </span></a> spirit and your life, as ye now contemn your own selves for his laws’ sake.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But Antiochus, thinking himself to be despised, and suspecting the reproachful voice, whilst the youngest was yet alive did not only make his appeal <span class='add'>to him </span> by words, but also at the same time promised with oaths that he would enrich him and <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup">Gr. make him one that is counted happy. </span></a> raise him to high estate, if he would turn from the <span class='add'>customs </span> of his fathers, and that he would take him for his <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup">See ch. viii. 9. </span></a> Friend and intrust him with affairs.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But when the young man would in no wise give heed, the king called unto him his mother, and exhorted her that she would counsel the lad to save himself.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when he had exhorted her with many words, she undertook to persuade her son.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But bending toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, she spoke thus in the language of her fathers: My son, have pity upon me that carried thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee suck three years, and nourished and brought thee up unto this age, and sustained thee.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>I beseech thee, my child, to lift thine eyes unto the heaven and the earth, and to see all things that are therein, and thus to recognise that God made them not of things that were, and <span class='add'>that </span> the race of men in this wise cometh into being.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Fear not this butcher, but, proving thyself worthy of thy brethren, accept thy death, that in the mercy <span class='add'>of God </span> I may receive thee again with thy brethren.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But before she had yet ended speaking, the young man said, Whom wait ye for? I obey not the commandment of the king, but I hearken to the commandment of the law that was given to our fathers through Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But thou, that hast devised all manner of evil against the Hebrews, shalt in no wise escape the hands of God.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For we are suffering because of our own sins;   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>and if for rebuke and chastening our living Lord hath been angered a little while, yet shall he again be reconciled with his own servants.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But thou, O unholy man and of all most vile, be not vainly lifted up in thy wild pride with uncertain hopes, raising thy hand against the heavenly children;   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For not yet hast thou escaped the judgement of the Almighty God that seeth <span class='add'>all things. </span>   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For these our brethren, having endured a <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup">Gr. short pain of ever-flowing life. </span></a> short pain that bringeth everlasting life, have now <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Gr. fallen.
