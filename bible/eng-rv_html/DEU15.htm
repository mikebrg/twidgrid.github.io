And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou lettest him go free from thee; for to the double of the hire of an hireling hath he served thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thine ox, nor shear the firstling of thy flock.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And if it have any blemish, <span class='add'>as if it be </span>lame or blind, any ill blemish whatsoever, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean <span class='add'>shall eat it </span>alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
