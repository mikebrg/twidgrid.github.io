Nay, my brethren, provoke not the Lord our God to anger.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For if he be not minded to help us within these five days, he hath power to defend us in such time as he will, or to destroy us before the face of our enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But do not ye pledge the counsels of the Lord our God: for God is not as man, that he should be threatened; neither as the son of man, that he should be turned by intreaty.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Wherefore let us wait for the salvation that cometh from him, and call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it please him.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For there arose none in our age, neither is there any of us to-day, tribe, or kindred, or family, or city, which worship gods made with hands, as it was in the former days;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>for the which cause our fathers were given to the sword, and for a spoil, and fell with a great fall before our enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But we know none other god beside him, wherefore we hope that he will not despise us, nor any of our race.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For if we be taken so, all Judaea shall sit upon the ground, and our sanctuary shall be spoiled; and of our blood shall he require the profanation thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the slaughter of our brethren, and the captivity of the land, and the desolation of our inheritance, shall he turn upon our heads among the Gentiles, wheresoever we shall be in bondage; and we shall be an offence and a reproach before them that take us for a possession.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For our bondage shall not be ordered to favour: but the Lord our God shall turn it to dishonour.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And now, brethren, let us shew an example to our brethren, because their soul hangeth upon us, and the sanctuary and the house and the altar rest upon us.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Besides all this let us give thanks to the Lord our God, which trieth us, even as he did our fathers also.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Remember all the things which he did to Abraham, and all the things in which he tried Isaac, and all the things which happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, when he kept the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For he hath not tried us in the fire, as he did them, to search out their hearts, neither hath he taken vengeance on us; but the Lord doth scourge them that come near unto him, to admonish them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Ozias said to her, All that thou hast spoken hast thou spoken with a good heart, and there is none that shall gainsay thy words.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For this is not the first day wherein thy wisdom is manifested; but from the beginning of thy days all the people have known thine understanding, because the disposition of thy heart is good.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But the people were exceeding thirsty, and compelled us to do as we spake to them, and to bring an oath upon ourselves, which we will not break.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And now pray thou for us, because thou art a godly woman, and the Lord shall send us rain to fill our cisterns, and we shall faint no more.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Judith said unto them, Hear me, and I will do a thing, which shall go down to all generations among the children of our race.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Ye shall stand at the gate this night, and I will go forth with my maid: and, within the days after which ye said that ye would deliver the city to our enemies, the Lord shall visit Israel by my hand.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But ye shall not inquire of mine act: for I will not declare it unto you, till the things be finished that I do.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Ozias and the rulers said unto her, Go in peace, and the Lord God be before thee, to take vengeance on our enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And they returned from the tent, and went to their stations.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
