 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the life of Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years: these were the years of the life of Sarah.

 <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth, saying, 
  <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_23_3	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 23:3	"><p><p>

 <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 
 <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,  
 <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.  
 <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.  
 <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,  
 <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a buryingplace. 
 <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_23_10	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 23:10	"><p><p>

 <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. 
 <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land. 
 <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there. 
 <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
 <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>My lord, hearken unto me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. 
 <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current <span class='add'>money </span>with the merchant. <p><p><img src="../img/	Genesis_23_16	.webp " class="square-img" alt="	Gen 23:16	"><p><p>

 <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure   
 <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
