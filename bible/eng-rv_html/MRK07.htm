Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, <span class='add'>it </span>cannot defile him;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? <span class='add'>This he said</span>, making all meats clean.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it: and he could not be hid.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord: even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the devil gone out.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
