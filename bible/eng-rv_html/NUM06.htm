he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the husk.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>All the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall not come near to a dead body.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because his separation unto God is upon his head.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and the priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he shall separate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a he-lamb of the first year for a guilt offering: but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tent of meeting:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and he shall offer his oblation unto the LORD, one he-lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the priest shall present them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also the meal offering thereof, and the drink offering thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he hath shaven <span class='add'>the head of </span>his separation:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD; this is holy for the priest, together with the wave breast and heave thigh: and after that the Nazirite may drink wine.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth, <span class='add'>and of </span>his oblation unto the LORD for his separation, beside that which he is able to get: according to his vow which he voweth, so he must do after the law of his separation.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel; ye shall say unto them,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The LORD make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So shall they put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
