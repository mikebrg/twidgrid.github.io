But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, <span class='add'>even </span>unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.]   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am <span class='add'>he</span>, ye shall die in your sins.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <span class='add'>he</span>, and <span class='add'>that </span>I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>As he spake these things, many believed on him.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said to those Jews which had believed him, If ye abide in my word, <span class='add'>then </span>are ye truly my disciples;   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They answered unto him, We be Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I speak the things which I have seen with <span class='add'>my </span>Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from <span class='add'>your </span>father.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, <span class='add'>even </span>God.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Why do ye not understand my speech? <span class='add'>Even </span>because ye cannot hear my word.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Ye are of <span class='add'>your </span>father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear <span class='add'>them </span>not, because ye are not of God.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?   <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;   <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.   <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.   <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?   <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.   <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
