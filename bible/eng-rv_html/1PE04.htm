Amen.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you, which cometh upon you to prove you, as though a strange thing happened unto you:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but insomuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exceeding joy.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed <span class='add'>are ye</span>; because the <span class='add'>Spirit </span>of glory and the Spirit of God resteth upon you.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other men’s matters:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>but if <span class='add'>a man suffer </span>as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the time <span class='add'>is come </span>for judgment to begin at the house of God: and if <span class='add'>it begin </span>first at us, what <span class='add'>shall be </span>the end of them that obey not the gospel of God?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing unto a faithful Creator.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
