Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If he pass through, and shut up, and call unto judgment, then who can hinder him?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For he knoweth vain men: he seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But vain man is void of understanding, yea, man is born as a wild ass’s colt.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If thou set thine heart aright, and stretch out thine hands toward him;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For thou shalt forget thy misery; thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>thy </span>life shall be clearer than the noonday; though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt search <span class='add'>about thee</span>, and shalt take thy rest in safety.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall have no way to flee, and their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
