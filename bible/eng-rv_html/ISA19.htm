Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and cometh unto Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, <span class='add'>and </span>kingdom against kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the spirit of Egypt shall be made void in the midst of it; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek unto the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and become dry.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the rivers shall stink; the streams of Egypt shall be minished and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither away.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all that is sown by the Nile, shall become dry, be driven away, and be no more.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The fishers also shall lament, and all they that cast angle into the Nile shall mourn, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Moreover they that work in combed flax, and they that weave white cloth, shall be ashamed.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And her pillars shall be broken in pieces, all they that work for hire <span class='add'>shall be </span>grieved in soul.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Where then are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now; and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed concerning Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray, that are the corner stone of her tribes.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The LORD hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her: and they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>It In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the land of Judah shall become a terror unto Egypt, every one to whom mention is made thereof shall be afraid, because of the purpose of the LORD of hosts, which he purposeth against it.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called The city of destruction.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a defender, and he shall deliver them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day; yea, they shall worship with sacrifice and oblation, and shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and shall perform it.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the LORD shall smite Egypt, smiting and healing; and they shall return unto the LORD, and he shall be entreated of them, and shall heal them.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>for that the LORD of hosts hath blessed them, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
