But the LORD hearkened unto me that time also.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So I fell down before the LORD the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I prayed unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thy stretched out arm.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
