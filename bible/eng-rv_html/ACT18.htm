And Gallio cared for none of these things.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchreae: for he had a vow.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when they asked him to abide a longer time, he consented not;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again unto you, if God will, he set sail from Ephesus.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And having spent some time <span class='add'>there</span>, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order, stablishing all the disciples.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, a learned man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught carefully the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more carefully.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped them much which had believed through grace:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>for he powerfully confuted the Jews, <span class='add'>and that </span>publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
