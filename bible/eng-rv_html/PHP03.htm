To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision:   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more:   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may gain Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, <span class='add'>even </span>that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death;   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may apprehend that for which also I was apprehended by Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Brethren, I count not myself yet to have apprehended: but one thing <span class='add'>I do</span>, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, even this shall God reveal unto you:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>only, whereunto we have already attained, by that same <span class='add'>rule </span>let us walk.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them which so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, <span class='add'>that they are </span>the enemies of the cross of Christ:   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and <span class='add'>whose </span>glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, <span class='add'>that it may be </span>conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
