And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and they shall amerce him in an hundred <span class='add'>shekels </span>of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel:   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the harlot in her father’s house: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away the evil from Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife: so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter:   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>for he found her in the field; the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel’s father fifty <span class='add'>shekels </span>of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he hath humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
