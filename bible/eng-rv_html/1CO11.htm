What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, how that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as oft as ye drink <span class='add'>it</span>, in remembrance of me.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
