how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for the Lord, the LORD of hosts, hath a work <span class='add'>to do </span>in the land of the Chaldeans.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; camp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together: and all that took them captives hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Their redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>A sword is upon their horse, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her, and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up: for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad upon idols.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation, and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses; every one set in array, as man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>The king of Babylon hath heard the fame of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, <span class='add'>and </span>pangs as of a woman in travail.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of Jordan against the strong habitation: but I will suddenly make them run away from her; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over her: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me?   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, <span class='add'>even </span>the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
