But Sarah met them; and she saluted them, and they her; and she brought them into the house.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he said to Edna his wife, How like is the young man to Tobit my cousin.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Raguel asked them, From whence are ye, brethren? And they said unto him, We are of the sons of Naphtali, which are captives in Nineveh.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Know ye Tobit our brother? But they said, We know him. And he said unto them, Is he in good health?   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But they said, He is both alive, and in good health: and Tobias said, He is my father.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Raguel sprang up, and kissed him, and wept,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and blessed him, and said unto him, Thou art the son of an honest and good man. And when he had heard that Tobit had lost his sight, he was grieved, and wept;   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and Edna his wife and Sarah his daughter wept.

Howbeit I will shew thee the truth.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I have given my child to seven men, and whensoever they came in unto her, they died in the night.
