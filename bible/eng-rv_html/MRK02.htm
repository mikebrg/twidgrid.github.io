And he arose and followed him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that he was sitting at meat in his house, and many publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans, said unto his disciples, He eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And when Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say unto him, Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>No man seweth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment: else that which should fill it up taketh from it, the new from the old, and a worse rent is made.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And no man putteth new wine into old wineskins: else the wine will burst the skins, and the wine perisheth, and the skins: but <span class='add'>they put </span>new wine into fresh wineskins.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that he was going on the sabbath day through the cornfields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests, and gave also to them that were with him?   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>so that the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
