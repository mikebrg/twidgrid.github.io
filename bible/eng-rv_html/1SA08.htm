And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots:   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands and captains of fifties; and <span class='add'>he will set some </span>to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not answer you in that day.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
