Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, The earth swallowed them.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou in thy mercy hast led the people which thou hast redeemed: Thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The peoples have heard, they tremble: Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then were the dukes of Edom amazed; The mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them: All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Terror and dread falleth upon them; By the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone; Till thy people pass over, O LORD, Till the people pass over which thou hast purchased.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, The place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, The sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
