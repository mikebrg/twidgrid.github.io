And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when he knew that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Many ancient authorities insert ver. 17 Now he must needs release unto them at the feast one prisoner.

I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But they were instant with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>the sun’s light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good man and a righteous   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), <span class='add'>a man </span>of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God:   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain.   <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.   <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And the women, which had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.   <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
