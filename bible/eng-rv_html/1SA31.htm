But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they put his armour in the house of the Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
