God forbid.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I have been crucified with Christ; yet I live; <span class='add'>and yet </span>no longer I, but Christ liveth in me: and that <span class='add'>life </span>which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, <span class='add'>the faith </span>which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nought.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
