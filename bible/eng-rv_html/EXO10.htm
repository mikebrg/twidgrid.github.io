And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God; but who are they that shall go?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said unto them, So be the LORD with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the LORD turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>they saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Moses said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no more.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
