Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Do not they blaspheme the honourable name by the which ye are called?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Howbeit if ye fulfill the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one <span class='add'>point</span>, he is become guilty of all.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For judgment <span class='add'>is </span>without mercy to him that hath shewed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If a brother or sister be naked, and in lack of daily food,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith apart from <span class='add'>thy </span>works, and I by my works will shew thee <span class='add'>my </span>faith.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and shudder.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
