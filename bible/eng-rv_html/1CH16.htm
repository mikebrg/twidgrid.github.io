and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto the LORD, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>O give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name; make known his doings among the peoples.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; talk ye of all his marvelous works.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Seek ye the LORD and his strength; seek his face evermore.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Remember his marvelous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Remember his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span><span class='add'>The covenant </span>which he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>When ye were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and sojourners in it;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they went about from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span><span class='add'>Saying</span>, Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth his salvation from day to day.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For all the gods of the peoples are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Honour and majesty are before him: strength and gladness are in his place.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples, give unto the LORD glory and strength.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Tremble before him, all the earth: the world also is stablished that it cannot be moved.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; and let them say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Let the sea roar and the fulness thereof; let the field exult, and all that is therein;   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before the LORD, for he cometh to judge the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy <span class='add'>endureth </span>for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required:   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers:   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded unto Israel;   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy <span class='add'>endureth </span>for ever;   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>and with them Heman and Jeduthun <span class='add'>with </span>trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and <span class='add'>with </span>instruments for the songs of God: and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
