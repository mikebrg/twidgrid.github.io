This also is vanity and a striving after wind.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Better is an handful with quietness, than two handfuls with labour and striving after wind.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, <span class='add'>saith he</span>, do I labour, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth: but how can one be warm <span class='add'>alone</span>?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I saw all the living which walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
