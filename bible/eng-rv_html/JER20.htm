Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the precious things thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughingstock all the day, every one mocketh me.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and spoil: because the word of the LORD is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in mine heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot <span class='add'>contain</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, <span class='add'>say </span>all my familiar friends, they that watch for my halting; peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the LORD is with me as a mighty one <span class='add'>and </span>a terrible: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonour which shall never be forgotten.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontide;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>because he slew me not from the womb; and so my mother should have been my grave, and her womb always great.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?   </div><ul class='tnav'>
