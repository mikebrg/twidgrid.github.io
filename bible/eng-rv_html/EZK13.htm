  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And mine hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one buildeth up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered <span class='add'>mortar</span>:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>say unto them which daub it with untempered <span class='add'>mortar</span>, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume it.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered <span class='add'>mortar</span>, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered: and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thus will I accomplish my fury upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered <span class='add'>mortar</span>; and I will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span><span class='add'>to wit</span>, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Woe to the women that sew pillows upon all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of <span class='add'>persons of </span>every stature to hunt souls! will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make <span class='add'>them </span>fly, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make <span class='add'>them </span>fly.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>therefore ye shall no more see vanity, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
