<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 48</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Of Moab. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe unto Nebo! for it is laid waste; Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken: Misgab is put to shame and broken down.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her, Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation. Thou also, O Madmen, shalt be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue thee.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The sound of a cry from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction!   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up; for in the going down of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For, because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his princes together.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed; as the LORD hath spoken.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Give wings unto Moab, that she may fly and get her away: and her cities shall become a desolation, without any to dwell therein.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD negligently, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remaineth in him, and his scent is not changed.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him them that pour off, and they shall pour him off; and they shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles in pieces.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>How say ye, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moab is laid waste, and they are gone up into her cities; and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>All ye that are round about him, bemoan him, and all ye that know his name; say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod!   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>O thou daughter that dwellest in Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab is come up against thee, he hath destroyed thy strong holds.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy: ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth; say, What hath been done?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moab is put to shame; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Make ye him drunken; for he magnified himself against the LORD: and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for as often as thou speakest of him, thou waggest the head.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>O ye inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock; and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the holes mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>We have heard of the pride of Moab, <span class='add'>that </span>he is very proud; his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogancy, and the haughtiness of his heart.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I know his wrath, saith the LORD, that it is nought; his boastings have wrought nothing.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore will I howl for Moab; yea, I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir-heres shall they mourn.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah: thy branches passed over the sea, they reached even to the sea of Jazer: upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage the spoiler is fallen.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And gladness and joy is taken away, from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to cease from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, even unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, to Eglath-shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high place, and him that burneth incense to his gods.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Therefore mine heart soundeth for Moab like pipes, and mine heart soundeth like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: therefore the abundance that he hath gotten is perished.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For every head is bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof there is lamentation every where: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>How is it broken down! <span class='add'>how </span>do they howl! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab become a derision and a dismaying to all that are round about him.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For thus saith the LORD: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread out his wings against Moab.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon her, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>They that fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon: for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and hath devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Woe unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh is undone: for thy sons are taken away captive, and thy daughters into captivity.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
