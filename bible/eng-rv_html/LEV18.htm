thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father’s nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or of thy daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she is thy father’s near kinswoman.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: for she is thy mother’s near kinswoman.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is thy son’s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it is thy brother’s nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And thou shalt not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival <span class='add'>to her</span>, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour’s wife, to defile thyself with her.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make them pass through <span class='add'>the fire </span>to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto: it is confusion.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the homeborn, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you:   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore shall ye keep my charge, that ye do not any of these abominable customs, which were done before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
