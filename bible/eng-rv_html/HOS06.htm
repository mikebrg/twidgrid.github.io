O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are <span class='add'>as </span>the light that goeth forth.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, it is stained with blood.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In the house of Israel I have seen an horrible thing: there whoredom is <span class='add'>found </span>in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Also, O Judah, there is an harvest appointed for thee, when I bring again the captivity of my people.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
