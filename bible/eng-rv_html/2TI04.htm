Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is useful to me for ministering.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>of whom be thou ware also; for he greatly withstood our words.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom <span class='add'>be </span>the glory for ever and ever. Amen.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Do thy diligence to come before winter.
