And she constrained us.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, which proclaim unto you the way of salvation.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened; and every one’s bands were loosed.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the jailor being roused out of sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword, and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he called for lights, and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he brought them up into his house, and set meat before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the jailor reported the words to Paul, <span class='add'>saying</span>, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the serjeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans;   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And they went out of the prison, and entered into <span class='add'>the house of </span>Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
