Then he suffereth him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
