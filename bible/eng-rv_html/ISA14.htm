art thou become like unto us?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thy pomp is brought down to hell, <span class='add'>and </span>the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and worms cover thee.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>How art thou fallen from heaven, O day star, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst lay low the nations!   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou saidst in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit upon the mount of congregation, in the uttermost parts of the north:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the uttermost parts of the pit.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, they shall consider thee, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>that made the world as a wilderness, and overthrew the cities thereof; that let not loose his prisoners to their home?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>All the kings of the nations, all of them, sleep in glory, every one in his own house.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But thou art cast forth away from thy sepulchre like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain, that are thrust through with the sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under foot.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people; the seed of evil-doers shall not be named for ever.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Prepare ye slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they rise not up, and possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and son’s son, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulder.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee, because the rod that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a basilisk, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and thy remnant shall be slain.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou art melted away, O Philistia, all of thee; for there cometh a smoke out of the north, and none standeth aloof at his appointed times.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>What then shall one answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and in her shall the afflicted of his people take refuge.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
