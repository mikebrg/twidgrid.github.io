Then answered I, and said, Amen, O LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry unto me, but I will not hearken unto them.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness <span class='add'>with </span>many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense unto Baal.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the LORD gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then thou shewedst me their doings.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and there shall be no remnant unto them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
