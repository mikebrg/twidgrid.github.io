 </div><div class='q'>They perished by the battle of my Lord.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I will sing unto my God a new song:  </div><div class='q'>O Lord, thou art great and glorious,  </div><div class='q'>Marvellous in strength, invincible.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let all thy creation serve thee:  </div><div class='q'>For thou spakest, and they were made,  </div><div class='q'>Thou didst send forth thy spirit, and it builded them,  </div><div class='q'>And there is none that shall resist thy voice.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For the mountains shall be moved from their foundations with the waters,  </div><div class='q'>And the rocks shall melt as wax at thy presence:  </div><div class='q'>But thou art yet merciful to them that fear thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For all sacrifice is little for a sweet savour,  </div><div class='q'>And all the fat is very little for a whole burnt offering to thee:  </div><div class='q'>But he that feareth the Lord is great continually.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Woe to the nations that rise up against my race:  </div><div class='q'>The Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgement,  </div><div class='q'>To put fire and worms in their flesh;  </div><div class='q'>And they shall weep and feel their pain for ever.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now when they came to Jerusalem, they worshipped God; and when the people were purified, they offered their whole burnt offerings, and their freewill offerings, and their gifts.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Judith dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken for herself out of his bedchamber, for a gift unto the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for the space of three months, and Judith remained with them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But after these days every one departed to his own inheritance, and Judith went away to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, and was honourable in her time in all the land.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And many desired her, and no man knew her all the days of her life, from the day that Manasses her husband died and was gathered to his people.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And she increased in greatness exceedingly; and she waxed old in her husband’s house, unto a hundred and five years, and let her maid go free: and she died in Bethulia; and they buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the house of Israel mourned for her seven days: and she distributed her goods before she died to all them that were nearest of kin to Manasses her husband, and to them that were nearest of her own kindred.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afraid in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
