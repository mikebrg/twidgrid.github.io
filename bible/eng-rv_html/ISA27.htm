I would march upon them, I would burn them together.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; <span class='add'>yea</span>, let him make peace with me.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In days to come shall Jacob take root; Israel shall blossom and bud: and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Hath he smitten him as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by him?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>In measure, when thou sendest her away, thou dost contend with her; he hath removed <span class='add'>her </span>with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, <span class='add'>so that </span>the Asherim and the sun-images shall rise no more.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the defenced city is solitary, an habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding; therefore he that made them will not have compassion upon them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat off <span class='add'>his fruit</span>, from the flood of the River unto the brook of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great trumpet shall be blown; and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and they that were outcasts in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship the LORD in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
