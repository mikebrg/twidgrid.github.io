Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers?   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Tell ye your children of it, and <span class='add'>let </span>your children <span class='add'>tell </span>their children, and their children another generation.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw teeth of a great lion.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The meal offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD’S ministers, mourn.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Be ashamed, O ye husbandmen, howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field is perished.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The vine is withered, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Gird yourselves <span class='add'>with sackcloth</span>, and lament, ye priests; howl, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meal offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men <span class='add'>and </span>all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, <span class='add'>yea</span>, joy and gladness from the house of our God?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>O LORD, to thee do I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto thee: for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
