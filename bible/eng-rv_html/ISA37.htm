And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest upon the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>this is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? <span class='add'>even </span>against the Holy One of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into his farthest height, the forest of his fruitful field.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field <span class='add'>of corn </span>before it be grown up.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Because of thy raging against me, and for that thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform this.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast a mount against it.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when men arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
