Developed by TeamKill Media, Code Violet is a Third-Person Action Horror game, where you take on the role of Violet Sinclair, a girl plucked from the past who must unravel the mysteries of the Aion Bioengineering Complex as she avoids, hides or fights against the creatures who have overrun it. With the evacuation protocol in effect, Violet’s main goal is to escape the complex and save those she cares for, but with the dinosaurs and a mysterious Director doing all in their power to stop you, will you get out alive?
