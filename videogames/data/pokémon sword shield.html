Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield are 2019 role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch console. They are the first instalments in the 8th generation of the Pokémon video game series. First teased at E3 2017 and announced in February 2019, the games were released on 15 November 2019. The games were accompanied by a downloadable content (DLC) expansion pass consisting of Part 1—The Isle of Armor (released in June 2020) and Part 2—The Crown Tundra (October 2020); its launch marked the first ever DLC released as part of the Pokémon video game series instead of an improved version.<p>In the game story, a young Pokémon Trainer begins their adventure in the Galar region along with their friend/rival Hop as they join the Gym Challenge that allows them to compete with others for the title of Pokémon Champion, due to them both getting a letter from Hop's brother and undefeated Champion of the region Leon. The games introduced many new features including the Dynamax and Gigantamax mechanic, which causes a player's Pokémon to grow to a significantly larger size and use more powerful attacks in battle. Conceptualization of the game began immediately following the completion of Pokémon Sun and Moon in 2016, while full development began a year later. The games were designed around the intent of utilizing the improved hardware capabilities of the Nintendo Switch. The Dynamax mechanic was similarly designed around the ability to see larger battles then were previously possible in the series.<p>Pokémon games feature a system where Pokémon from past games are able to be transferred into newer installments; when it was announced that Sword and Shield would exclude many pre-existing Pokémon from being usable in the games, it triggered a backlash from fans who called it "Dexit" as a nod to Brexit and resulted in an extensive controversy. Sword and Shield received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the games' gameplay, exploration, and mechanics, although the lack of innovation received some criticism. As of June 2025, the games had sold more than 26 million copies worldwide, making them the third best-selling titles in the Pokémon video game series. The games won awards at the SXSW Gaming Awards and Famitsu Dengeki Game Awards 2019.
