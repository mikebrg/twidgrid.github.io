Wii Sports Resort is a 2009 sports simulation video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii video game console. It is the sequel to Wii Sports (2006). It is the first first-party Wii game to support the Wii MotionPlus accessory and the first game overall to require it, which was bundled with the game. Wii Sports Resort was first announced at E3 2008 and was released in Japan on June 25, 2009, and in nearly all other regions the following month. While Wii Sports Resort was first released as a stand-alone title, it was later bundled with newer Wii consoles alongside Wii Sports.
