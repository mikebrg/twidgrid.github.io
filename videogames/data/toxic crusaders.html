When the evil Dr. Killemoff attacks, only one team of hideously deformed creatures of superhuman size and strength stands between him and his plans for global pollution: the Toxic Crusaders, earth's last, greatest and ugliest hope for survival! The hottest heroes of 1991 return for a radical, radioactive beat 'em up for a new era, featuring awesome action, crushing combos and more toxic waste than you'll know what to do with! Choose from seven playable characters, including Toxie, No-Zone, Junkyard, Major Disaster and Headbanger (who would technically count as two characters if they could only agree on something) - plus, for the first time, play as Toxie's musically "gifted" girlfriend Yvonne, and the mother of all mothers, Mrs. Junko, Toxie's mom! Battle across seven disgusting levels rendered in beautiful full-color pixel art as you defend Tromaville from hordes of Radiation Rangers, mutated thugs and zombie chickens. The odds might be stacked against you but with awesome powers, a winning personality and up to four-player local co-up on your side, the Smogulan Empire's days are numbered! Take a deep breath and dive deep into an action-packed, pun-filled adventure that drags you kicking and screaming through the wonderful world of Troma. Enjoy cameos from gore-filled classics such as Class of Nuke 'Em High, Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. - reimagined in the Saturday morning cartoon style that made this franchise so unforgettable!
