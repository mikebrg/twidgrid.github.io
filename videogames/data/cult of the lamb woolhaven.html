Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
A lost God calls you from a mysterious mountain: you must rebuild the flock and reawaken winter to uncover the truth of the fallen lambs. Face the past before it consumes you in this full-length, feature-packed expansion. Return the lost souls of Woolhaven to their spiritual home and learn the long-forgotten history of lambkind. Rebuild the fallen town to its former glory and reclaim the mountain to restore the depleted power of Yngya, the forgotten God of the lambs. But beware: there is always a price to be paid. Endure harsh weather, including blizzards and freezing temperatures, that threaten your Cult’s survival. Build new structures to keep your loyal followers warm and protect them from frostbite and famine. Every soul redeemed on the mountain defiles it further, threatening all of The Lands of the Old Faith. Can you undo the sins of the past?
