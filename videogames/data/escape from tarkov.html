Escape from Tarkov is a multiplayer first-person tactical extraction-shooter video game in development by Battlestate Games for Microsoft Windows. The game is set in the fictional Norvinsk region in northwestern Russia, where a war is taking place between two private military companies (United Security 'USEC' and the Battle Encounter Assault Regiment 'BEAR'). Players join matches called 'raids' in which they fight other players and bots for loot and aim to survive and escape.
