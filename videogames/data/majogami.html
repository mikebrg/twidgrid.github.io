Majogami stars Shiroha, a young woman who has lost her memory, who travels alongside Shiori, her father who has been turned to paper. With her katana, “Kamikiri”, in hand, she travels through a bizarre world and cuts through the horrors she finds there in this 2D character action platformer. Players take control of Shiroha who can move and attack instantly with her “Setsuna” ability, taking out enemies without missing a beat. Along her journey, Shiroha will collect cards imbued with her memories called Recarte, and face off against the diverse Majogami, divine “Craft Witches” who control the world. The Craft Witches, with twisted hearts and powerful magic, stand in Shiroha’s way as she tries to escape their domain. In addition to her Setsuna attack, she can rely on Shiori’s defense sigils and the power of the guardians she meets, the Astrals, to transform herself into new fighting forms. By defeating these Craft Witches, Shiroha will slowly regain memories of both her and Shiori’s life, deepening their bonds and revealing her story.
