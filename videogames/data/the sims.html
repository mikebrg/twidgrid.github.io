The Sims is a 2000 social simulation video game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. The game allows players to create and control virtual people, called "Sims", and manage their daily lives in a suburban setting. The game features open-ended gameplay where players can choose their own goals and objectives, and customize their Sims' appearance, personality, skills, relationships, and environment. A series of expansion packs were also released that add new content and features to the game, such as new careers, items, locations, and scenarios.
