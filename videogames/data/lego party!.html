Lego Party is heavily inspired by franchises such as Mario Party, allowing four players to compete by rolling numbers and progressing through various boards. There are four levels to choose from, each inspired by an existing Lego theme, such as Lego Ninjago, Lego Pirates, and Lego Space. Varying spots on the board will have effects on the player, such as handing them a disadvantage through traps or allowing them to progress further with shortcuts. The goal is to acquire as many golden Lego bricks as possible before the end of the game.
