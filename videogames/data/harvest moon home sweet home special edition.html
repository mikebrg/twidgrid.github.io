Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home Special Edition invites you to leave behind the hustle and bustle of city life and return to your childhood village of Alba - a peaceful countryside town where the fish are fresh, the vegetables are homegrown, and the locals are as warm as ever. Tend to crops, care for animals, fish, mine, and gather resources to collect Happiness, the key to growing Alba Village. Participate in lively festivals, compete in local contests, and help bring life back to the heart of the countryside. Your home is calling - are you ready to return?
