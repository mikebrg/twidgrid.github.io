" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
This time, our heroes leave their beloved village for a long journey through the Parthian Empire, a faraway kingdom under threat from Roman invasion. Their mission? To save Monipehni, the King of the Parthians, who has fallen victim to a deadly poison brewed by Bahmbuhzeli, a treacherous sorcerer allied with Caesar. Along the way, they will need to gather the ingredients for the antidote while fending off fierce Roman legionaries. They will also lend a hand to local villagers in exotic and enchanting landscapes. Thanks to their courage, their legendary resourcefulness and plenty of well-placed slaps, Asterix and Obelix will push back the invaders and prove that the indomitable Gauls are unbeatable, no matter how far from home they may be!
