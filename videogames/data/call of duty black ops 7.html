Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is a first-person shooter game co-developed by Treyarch and Raven Software and published by Activision. It is the twenty-second installment of the Call of Duty series and is the eighth main entry in the Black Ops sub-series, following Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (2024). Set in 2035, Black Ops 7's story—playable in single-player or co-op—will follow a team of agents led by David Mason in the aftermath of Call of Duty: Black Ops II (2012). As with previous Call of Duty titles, the game will also include a multiplayer component and the cooperative round-based Zombies mode.
