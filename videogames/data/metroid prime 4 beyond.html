Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is a 2025 action-adventure game developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2. It is the tenth main game in the Metroid series. Players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran, who is transported to the undiscovered planet Viewros. She is tasked with a mission from its inhabitants, the Lamorn, and fights for survival while confronting her rival Sylux, who holds a grudge against her and the Galactic Federation.<p>Beyond retains the first-person adventure gameplay of previous Metroid Prime games, as players guide Samus through non-linear environments, fighting enemies, finding upgrades that augment her abilities, and scanning various details and life-forms to procure information on her surroundings. However, Samus gains psychic abilities that she can use to control the trajectory of beam shots from her arm cannon, or to manipulate objects to solve puzzles. She also commandeers a motorcycle, the Vi-0-La, for riding across larger expanses. The Nintendo Switch 2 version includes support for the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, which provide more precise aiming.<p>Nintendo announced Metroid Prime 4 for Switch at E3 2017. It was initially developed by a team at Bandai Namco Studios overseen by Kensuke Tanabe, the producer of the previous Metroid Prime games. In 2019, unhappy with progress, Nintendo announced that development had restarted with Tanabe under Retro, who had developed the previous Prime games. Nintendo unveiled the game and its title in June 2024, and confirmed a cross-generation release with Switch 2 the following April.<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond released on December 4, 2025, eighteen years after Metroid Prime 3: Corruption (2007). It received generally positive reviews, with critics praising its level design, gameplay additions and enhanced graphical fidelity on Switch 2, although the non-player characters and open world elements received criticism.
