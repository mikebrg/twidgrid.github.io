Terminator 2D: No Fate is an action video game developed by Bitmap Bureau and published by Reef Entertainment for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. The game takes place during events of the movie, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The game was released on December 12, 2025. It was originally scheduled to be released on October 31, 2025, but was delayed due to "ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for [the] Day One and Collector's Editions." The game was then set to be released on November 25, 2025 but was delayed again to give the publisher time to complete physical editions of the game.
