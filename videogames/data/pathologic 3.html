Bachelor Daniil Dankovsky is a young doctor from the capital. His search for the secret of immortality brings him to a remote town, gripped by a mysterious plague that will destroy it in 12 days. Now it’s up to him to explore the town itself, its past, present, and future - to find answers to his numerous questions and try to stop the relentless epidemic. (At least… that’s what he thinks this story is about. What it’s supposed to be about. What it’s always been about.) Examine patients and diagnose diseases. Cross-check symptoms and prescribe treatments. Enforce your rules: impose quarantines, confiscate medicine, vaccinate the population, deploy patrols, and impose curfews. See how your choices change the town, even if it means being hated along the way. You have only 12 days to stop the lethal plague. But in your hands lies the most valuable resource - time. Travel into the future to witness the worst outcomes. Correct mistakes in the past to change them. Bend the fates of people around you to save or condemn you - in search of answers.
