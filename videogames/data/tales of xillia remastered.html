Experience Tales of Xillia, remastered for the first time ever. Dive into the magnificent world of Rieze Maxia as either Jude Mathis, an aspiring medical student from the capital, or Milla Maxwell, a mysterious woman accompanied by four powerful spirits. At the start of their epic journey through the vibrant world of Rieze Maxia—where humans and spirits coexist in harmony—players can choose to step into the shoes of either Milla or Jude. But peace is under threat. The kingdom of Rashugal has begun using a mysterious, powerful device that’s draining the world’s mana, the very essence of life. Determined to stop the destruction and restore balance, Milla and Jude embark on a daring quest to destroy the device and save their world.
