SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded fuses the best of Splitgate 1 & 2, bringing back that classic arena shooter feel. The Arena Is Back: No factions, no abilities, no limits. Choose the way you play– customizable loadouts or even starts–ranging from classic modes like Team Deathmatch and King of the Hill to party modes like Gun Game and Shotty Snipers. Grind & Progress: A completely rebuilt progression system rewards you with every match, and an overhauled Ranked system challenges the best of the best. New Maps, Weapons, & More: 5 new and 6 redesigned arenas, 3 new primary weapons, a new Power Weapon, and dozens of new features to discover.
