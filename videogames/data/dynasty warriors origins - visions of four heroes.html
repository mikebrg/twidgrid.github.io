A major DLC for 'DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS' focused on the unfulfilled dreams of four unsung heroes: Zhang Jiao, Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shao, and Lu Bu. Some heroes faded without ever fulfilling their dreams... But what if a Guardian of Peace had walked alongside them? Experience what could have been as you join forces with Zhang Jiao, Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shao, or Lu Bu, four unsung heroes from the main game. The DLC will feature an even more evolved form of the exhilarating battles of 1 vs. 1,000. New weapon types in the form of bows and rope darts, along with new Battle Arts and companions, will enable you to grow stronger and sweep across the battlefield alongside your chosen hero.
