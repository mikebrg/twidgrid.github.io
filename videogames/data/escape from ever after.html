A magical and mysterious place, legends say that the Sleepy Castle is a place where characters from classic bedtime stories can all gather and live together peacefully. But one day a powerful curse corrupted the castle's storybooks, turning these tales topsy-turvy and unleashing distorted storybook monsters out into the real world! With the once peaceful castle run amok with twisted tales, it's up to adventurer Flynt Buckler and his band of fairytale folk to dive into the cursed stories, correct the chaos, and save the day! Flynt Buckler Wakes the Sleepy Castle is an RPG inspired by the classic Paper Mario games featuring turn-based gameplay that keeps things fast, fun and whimsical.
