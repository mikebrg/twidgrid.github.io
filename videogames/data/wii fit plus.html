Wii Fit is a 2007 exergaming video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii. It features a variety of yoga, strength training, aerobics, and balance mini-games for use with the Wii Balance Board peripheral. Designer Hiroshi Matsunaga described the game as a "way to help get families exercising together". It has since been adopted by various health clubs around the world, and has previously been used for physiotherapy rehabilitation in children and in nursing homes to improve posture in the elderly.<p>The game has received generally positive reviews, despite criticism over the lack of intensity in some of its workout activities. As of March 2022, Wii Fit was the third best selling console game not to be packaged with a console, having sold 22.67 million copies.<p>Wii Fit Plus, an enhanced version featuring additional games, activities, and features, was released for the Wii in October 2009.
