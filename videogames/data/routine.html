Routine is a 2025 survival horror game developed by Lunar Software and published by Raw Fury. Set on a lunar base, the story follows an unnamed protagonist unraveling a mysterious incident that led to the base's decline. The game is played from a first-person perspective, with the player exploring the base and using a special device to fight hostile robots, interact with the environment, and perform other actions.<p>Announced in 2012, Routine is the debut title from Lunar Software. While initially slated for a spring 2013 release, the game saw several delays attributed to a protracted development cycle, financial hurdles, and the studio's decision to temporarily pause production due to dissatisfaction with the game's direction. Development resumed in 2020 with new publisher Raw Fury. The team then overhauled various aspects of the project, including its narrative, gameplay and art design, and transitioned to Unreal Engine 5. Mick Gordon, who was originally the audio designer for the game, left the project in 2024. Routine was released for Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in December 2025.
