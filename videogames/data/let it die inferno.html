Having finally recovered from the unprecedented destruction of Earth Rage, humanity was once again struck by a terrifying new menace. A giant chasm, large enough to swallow an entire city, suddenly opened up in the ground one day. How deep was it? What did it lead to? No one knew. Those who ventured to investigate all perished, and it became known as the dreaded “Hell Gate.” Common sense should have kept everyone away. But the discovery of a rare and valuable resource inside, along with the pull of a mysterious rumor, drove people to madness. “Deep within the Hole lies the Eye of the Reaper, a mass of SPLithium so large that whoever claims it could rule the world.” To find it, one would have to jump into the abyss and overcome unimaginable difficulties. To fight through nightmarish hybrid monsters, unsettling hostile environments, and humans consumed by greed. “Kill anyone who gets in the way” The Yotsuyama Group: a megacorporation who will stop at nothing in its cruelty and evil. Hell on earth, hell in the Hole. Your only safe haven? Iron Perch, a floating base in the sky. Defy Yotsuyama, and you're as good as dead. But don’t be afraid. You’re a Raider—an immortal adventurer. You can die and come back as many times as you want, switch Bodies, and race down a path of carnage! Take a death-defying dive into Hell from your base at an altitude of 30,000 feet. To become immortal, you will need to abandon your past and sever all ties. But don’t worry, you’re not alone. The coolest and wildest bunch there is is waiting for you at the Raiders Association! A tearful receptionist in mourning clothes, a badass one-armed older woman, a mysterious mask-wearing veteran, a storyteller gone rogue, a proud and beautiful Raider... and many more for you to meet!
