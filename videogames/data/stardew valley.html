Stardew Valley is a 2016 farm life simulation game developed by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. Players take the role of a character who inherits their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known as "Stardew Valley". Stardew Valley is an open-ended game where players manage a farm by clearing land, growing seasonal crops, and raising animals. Players can build skills in farming, foraging, fishing, mining, and combat. The game also includes social features, such as building relationships with townspeople, with the option to marry and have a maximum of two children. A later update added multiplayer, allowing online play with others.
