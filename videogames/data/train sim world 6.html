The ninth iteration of the series, Train Sim World 6, was announced on 8 July 2025, and was released on 30 September. The three base routes were NJ Transit’s Morristown Line, from Hoboken and New York Penn to Dover, New Jersey; the Exeter to Plymouth and Paignton Riviera Line in Devon, England; and Germany’s Bahnstrecke Leipzig-to-Dresden route. The latter was an extension of the older Dresden-to-Riesa featured in TSW2: Rush Hour.
