From the souls and blood of the fallen, a wounded spirit follows. The Dreglord awaits. ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN, the standalone multiplayer co-op survival action game by FromSoftware, Inc. and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc., is unleashing a new abomination onto players in the form of The Dreglord - one of the new final bosses in the ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN: THE FORSAKEN HOLLOWS DLC. The DLC introduces two new third day bosses, new field bosses, a new Shifting Earth -- a special condition where the map sees massive geographical changes, and new points of interest in Limveld for players to explore. Two new Nightfarers are joining the fray as well, with new abilities to take on the Night’s Tide.
