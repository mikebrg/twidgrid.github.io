The LEGO Adventurers theme was a popular, discontinued product line from 1998 to 2003 that centered around a 1920s-style explorer concept. It followed the main character, Johnny Thunder, and his team on global expeditions to find treasure and artifacts while battling villains like Lord Sam Sinister. <p>Theme Overview and Sub-themes<p>The theme was known for taking place in real-world locations and was divided into four distinct sub-themes, each with its own setting and storyline. <p>Egypt/Desert (1998): The initial theme, focused on Egyptian archaeology and culture, where the team searched for the Re-Gou Ruby and battled the undead Pharaoh Hotep and Baron von Barron.<p>Jungle/Amazon (1999): The adventure moved to the Amazon rainforest to find the ancient Sun Disc, with new villains Señor Palomar and Rudo Villano.<p>Dino Island (2000): The only fictional sub-theme, where the explorers discovered a mysterious island inhabited by dinosaurs and worked to capture specimens for research.<p>Orient Expedition (2003): The final, globe-trotting sub-theme across India, the Himalayas, and China to find the four legendary treasures of Marco Polo. <p>Key Characters<p>The Adventurers theme featured a cast of recurring heroes and villains.<p>Johnny Thunder: The Australian adventurer and main protagonist.<p>Dr. Kilroy (Dr. Charles Lightning): The team's intelligent geologist and scientist.<p>Pippin Reed (Gail Storm): A journalist and key member of the team.<p>Lord Sam Sinister (Baron von Barron): The long-time antagonist and rival who pursued the same artifacts as the heroes. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are no longer available new from retailers but can be found through re-sellers. <p>The Temple of Anubis (5988): The largest set from the Egypt wave, featuring a large temple and multiple minifigures.<p>River Expedition (5976): A popular set from the Jungle theme that included a large river boat and a unique blimp vehicle.<p>Dino Research Compound (5987): The primary base from the Dino Island theme, notable for including one of the first LEGO T-Rex figures.<p>Dragon Fortress (7419): The final, large set from the Orient Expedition theme, featuring a Chinese fortress and a large cast of characters. <p>Legacy<p>The Adventurers theme remains one of the most beloved original LEGO lines and is widely considered a spiritual predecessor to the official LEGO Indiana Jones license, which appeared several years later.
