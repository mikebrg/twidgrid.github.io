MacBook Air Tapered Unibody
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The MacBook Air Tapered Unibody line, released on October 20, 2010, was a significant redesign that introduced a new, thinner, and lighter wedge-shaped aluminum enclosure and, for the first time, both 11-inch and 13-inch screen sizes. It marked Apple's full transition to solid-state flash storage for instant-on performance and improved reliability. <p>Key Features and Connectivity<p>Design: A significantly thinner and lighter aluminum unibody enclosure that tapered from 0.68 inches at its thickest point to a mere 0.11 inches at the front.<p>Flash Storage Standard: This generation made solid-state flash storage standard across all configurations, a key factor in its responsiveness, durability, and compact size.<p>Ports: Connectivity options were still minimal to maintain the thin profile. Both models included two USB 2.0 ports, a headphone minijack, and a Mini DisplayPort for video output. The 13-inch model exclusively included an SD card slot.<p>Missing Features: It still lacked built-in Ethernet (requiring a separate USB adapter), FireWire ports, and an optical drive.
Keyboard: A full-size keyboard was standard on both models, but it was not backlit.<p>Battery Life: The 13-inch model offered up to 7 hours of wireless productivity, while the 11-inch model provided up to 5 hours.
