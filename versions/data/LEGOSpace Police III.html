The LEGO Space Police III theme was a classic space-themed product line that ran from June 2009 to the end of 2010, serving as the third iteration of the Space Police franchise. The theme centered around a group of intergalactic police officers patrolling the galaxy and incarcerating the most notorious space criminals. <p>Overview and Storyline<p>The narrative focused on the Space Police force and their efforts to capture a range of colorful, themed alien criminals who were escaping from an asteroid-based prison. The humans utilized sophisticated, sleek white and blue vehicles, while the aliens used ships that often matched their character's theme (e.g., a "Snake" alien in a green vehicle).<p>Factions: The theme was split between the heroic Space Police (mostly human officers with a few robot companions) and the diverse alien criminals, each with a unique gimmick.<p>Characters: Key Space Police officers included Agent Max Burns (a name later reused in Ultra Agents) and the Robot Communicator. Notable villains included the snake-like Snake, the robotic alien Slizer, and the main antagonist, the Minifigure Collector. <p>Construction Sets<p>A total of 15 sets and several promotional polybags were released across the theme's two-year run. The sets were known for their detailed designs and fun role-playing elements, such as working jail cells and capture functions. <p>Central Control Tower (5984): The main headquarters for the Space Police, featuring a command center, launch bay, and jail cells.<p>Galactic Enforcer (5974): The flagship spaceship of the Space Police, a large, detailed vessel designed for chasing down criminals.<p>Space Police Central (5973): A smaller police station set that was a great introduction to the theme.<p>Snakes's Vendetta (5972): A popular mid-sized set with a green alien vehicle and the character Snake.<p>Crawler Crane (5983): A large alien mining vehicle designed to collect resources. <p>Collectibility<p>The LEGO Space Police III theme is now retired and sets are no longer available in standard retail stores. Due to its fun, original story and classic space aesthetic, the sets are popular on secondary marketplaces like eBay and BrickLink. The large Galactic Enforcer ship and the unique alien minifigures are particularly sought after by collectors.
