The LEGO Islanders was a popular, discontinued theme and sub-theme within the LEGO Pirates line that ran from 1994 to 1996, with a small revival in 2000. It represented a native, peaceful, and fictional Polynesian culture that lived on an island archipelago. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The Islanders were a friendly, yet protective, group who lived in harmony with nature and built villages using natural materials like bamboo and leaves. Their conflict arose with the arrival of European-style pirates (Captain Redbeard) and Imperial soldiers who sought to steal their treasure, particularly a large, golden, brick-built statue. <p>Aesthetic: The sets featured a vibrant and unique color palette, primarily green, white, and a rare orange/brown color for the buildings. The minifigures had unique face paintings, tattoos, and elaborate headwear with feathers.<p>Animals: The theme introduced several new animal molds, including crocodiles, sharks, and the first official brick-built parrot.<p>Play Features: Sets often included functional components like rafts, catapults, and hidden treasure features. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are now highly sought-after collector's items and are only available on the secondary market from re-sellers. <p>Forbidden Island (Set number: 6278): The flagship set and main village for the Islanders, featuring a large, rock-based hideout with a working drawbridge and the golden idol statue.<p>King Kahuka's Throne (Set number: 6256): A smaller set featuring the King's ceremonial throne with a hidden treasure chest.<p>Enchanted Island (Set number: 6264): A medium-sized island set with a canon, a large palm tree, and a small raft for defense.<p>Island Chief (Set number: 6246): A small, affordable set with a single Islander minifigure on a raft.<p>Treasure Chest (Set number: 6236): A very small set featuring a treasure chest and a native Islander. <p>Legacy and Related Themes<p>LEGO Pirates (1989-1992, etc.): The main theme that the Islanders often interacted and conflicted with.<p>LEGO Adventurers: Jungle/Amazon (1999): While a separate theme, the "Jungle" sub-theme included a native character, Achu, who had a similar aesthetic to the Islanders.<p>LEGO Ideas Pirates of Barracuda Bay (21322): The modern, large-scale homage to the original Pirates theme also included a subtle nod to the Islanders in its design and some of its minifigure elements.
