The second-generation iPhone SE (also known as the iPhone SE 2 or the iPhone SE 2020) is a smartphone developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is part of the 13th generation of the iPhone, alongside the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro/Pro Max models. Apple announced it on April 15, 2020, coinciding with the discontinuation of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Orders began on April 17, 2020, and the phone was released on April 24, 2020. It was released with a starting price of US$399, and positioned as a budget phone.<p>Following the pattern of the first iPhone SE (which shares the form factor of the iPhone 5s, with the internal hardware of the iPhone 6s), the second-generation model shares the form factor of the iPhone 8, with internal components from the iPhone 11 lineup. It has components such as the Apple A13 Bionic system-on-chip, which allows the phone to utilize the single wide-angle lens Portrait Mode, as on the iPhone XR. It also features Smart HDR-2 photos, which are marketed as being better than Smart HDR photos on the iPhone XS and iPhone XR.
