The LEGO Space Police I theme was a popular, discontinued sub-theme of the LEGO Space line that ran from 1989 to 1990. It was the first "law enforcement" faction in the LEGO Space universe and featured a fleet of vehicles designed to capture the villainous Blacktron I faction. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The storyline depicted the Space Police I as the "good guys" whose mission was to patrol space and capture the Blacktron I criminals, who were smuggling illegal goods and technology. The theme was a direct counterpoint to the black-and-yellow Blacktron I sets.<p>Key features of the sets included:<p>Color Scheme: The Space Police I vehicles featured a uniform black, blue, and transparent red color scheme.<p>Modular Jail Cells: A core play feature was the use of a consistent, yellow jail cell system. These cells were designed to be easily detachable and transferable between all the sets in the theme, from small patrol ships to the main base, allowing for easy transfer of prisoners.<p>Capture Mechanisms: Ships were equipped with magnet cranes or grappling hooks to capture the Blacktron I's cargo containers or even their ships.<p>Minifigures: The minifigures wore white and blue uniforms with a distinct "SP" logo and helmets with visors. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are now highly sought-after collector's items and are only available on the secondary market from re-sellers. <p>Mission Commander (6986): The flagship set and main mobile base of operations, this large ship could separate into a large mothership and a smaller "buggy" vehicle and featured two modular jail cells.
Space Lock-Up Isolation Base (6959): The primary static base of operations, a prison station for holding the captured Blacktron I criminals, featuring a main control area and multiple jail cells.<p>Space Police Ship (6957): A medium-sized ship with a magnetic crane system for capturing cargo.<p>Space Scooter (6810): A very small, affordable scout vehicle that could still carry a jail cell. <p>Legacy and Related Themes<p>Blacktron I (1987-1988): The primary criminal faction in this storyline.<p>Space Police II (1992-1993): The direct successor theme with an updated color scheme and new villains (Blacktron II).<p>Space Police III (2009-2010): A modern, comedic take on the theme where the police battled a new array of colorful alien criminals.
