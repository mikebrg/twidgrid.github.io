The LEGO Castle theme is a classic LEGO line with a rich history dating back to 1978. While there is no current, dedicated "Castle" theme with ongoing multiple waves of sets, LEGO consistently releases standalone castle-themed products and licensed sets that cater to fans of medieval building. <p>History of the Theme<p>The Castle theme was one of the original three LEGOLAND themes, evolving from simple yellow castles into a complex world of various knightly factions, outlaws, and fantasy creatures. Over the decades, it has featured numerous sub-themes: <p>Classic Castle (1978-1983): The iconic "Yellow Castle" that launched the theme.<p>Factions Era (1984-1999): A "golden period" with competing groups like the Black Falcons, Lion Knights/Crusaders, Forestmen, and Dragon Masters.<p>Fantasy Eras (2000s): Themes like Knights' Kingdom II and the 2007 Castle theme introduced more fantasy elements like wizards, skeletons, trolls, and orcs.<p>Kingdoms (2010-2012): A return to a more realistic medieval setting with a war between the Lion Kingdom and Dragon Kingdom. <p>Current and Available "Castle" Sets (as of December 2025)<p>LEGO no longer uses the general "Castle" theme name for ongoing lines, but it has released several highly popular sets under different themes, often as homages to the classic era: <p>Lion Knights' Castle (10305):<p>Description: This large, detailed adult collector set (4,514 pieces) was released for the LEGO Group's 90th anniversary in 2022.
