The iPad (5th generation) (also referred to as the iPad 9.7-inch) is a tablet computer developed and marketed by Apple Inc. After its announcement on March 21, 2017, conflicting naming conventions spawned a number of different names, including "fifth-generation iPad" or "iPad (2017)".<p>The device was released five years after the previous fourth-generation iPad, as the iPad Air was released in 2013 as the successor to the iPad lineup. The iPad Air lineup later continued as a separate, higher-end device, while the iPad was positioned as an entry-level model.<p>Unlike the iPad Air 2, this iPad does not have a fully laminated display, and also lacks an anti-reflective coating.<p>On March 27, 2018, Apple announced its successor, the sixth-generation iPad.
