The LEGO Games theme (product code 38xx) was an experimental and short-lived product line that ran from 2009 to 2013, focusing on a series of buildable board games made entirely of LEGO bricks. <p>Theme Overview<p>The line was unique in the LEGO portfolio as it blurred the line between a traditional construction toy and a board game. Each set required the user to first build the game board and game elements (such as dice and microfigures), and then they could play the actual game with family and friends. <p>Customization: A key selling point was the ability to "build, play, and change" the rules and board layouts, encouraging creativity and replay value.<p>Game Mechanics: The games used a unique buildable LEGO die that could be customized to affect the gameplay outcomes.<p>Target Audience: The games were designed for various age groups, with most sets aimed at 6 to 10-year-olds.<p>Status: The theme was discontinued after four years due to limited success with consumers, as the games tended to have relatively simple rules and the build-to-play novelty eventually wore off. <p>Notable Sets<p>The theme included several different game types, from abstract strategy to race games, many with licensed properties. <p>LEGO Minotaurus (3841): One of the most popular and highest-rated original games in the series. It was a race/strategy game with a buildable Labyrinth and minotaur figure.<p>LEGO [Star Wars] The Battle of Hoth (3866): A licensed Star Wars game using microfigures based on the classic Hoth battle scene.<p>LEGO [The Lord of the Rings] The Battle of Helm's Deep (50003): A licensed game based on The Lord of the Rings film.<p>LEGO Harry Potter: Hogwarts (3862): A licensed game featuring moving staircases and key characters as microfigures.<p>LEGO Piraka (3851): An early game based on the Bionicle universe. <p>Legacy and Status<p>The LEGO Games theme is now retired, and the sets are no longer available in standard retail stores. They are considered collector's items and can be found on secondary marketplaces. While the product line itself ceased, the concept of integrating games into LEGO play has been explored in other ways, such as the digital-physical hybrids found in later themes like LEGO Dimensions and the use of game-like apps in LEGO Hidden Side.
