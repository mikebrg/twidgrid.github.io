The first LEGO Duplo figures were introduced in 1977 and had a simple, early design. They were block-like, non-posable figures, similar in some respects to finger puppets, designed for safety and ease of use by preschoolers. <p>Design of the 1977 Duplo Figures<p>These early figures were simple and robust, created as a safe and recognizable character for toddlers a year before the standard minifigure was released. <p>Appearance: They had a square base designed to fit over a 2x2 Duplo stud. The body was a single, simple, limbless piece with a white, cylindrical head on top.<p>Lack of Articulation: Unlike later Duplo figures, the original 1977 people had no movable arms or legs.<p>Safety: They were not designed to be taken apart, which prevented small parts from becoming a choking hazard for young children.<p>Variety: The figures came in various occupations and appearances, including a police officer, a boy, a girl, a sailor, and a chef. <p>Early Sets Featuring Duplo People<p>These first figures were included in various Duplo sets that aimed to represent everyday life scenarios. <p>LEGO Set 522 Police Station: One of the first sets to feature these original figures, including police officer characters.<p>LEGO Set 535 Taxi: A small set that included a simple car and a driver figure.<p>LEGO Set 089 Mary's House: A basic house set that introduced figures into a home environment. <p>These simple figures continued to be released intermittently, in parallel with later, more detailed styles, until around 1990.
