The LEGO M:Tron (short for "Mobile Tron") theme was a popular, discontinued sub-theme of the LEGO Space line that ran from 1990 to 1992. It focused on a group of human space explorers and salvage workers who used modular vehicles to transport cargo and energy across the galaxy. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The storyline depicted the M:Tron faction as benevolent explorers and miners who discovered valuable "energy crystals" (transparent-red cones and plates). They were often in conflict with the villainous Blacktron II faction, who sought to steal their cargo. <p>Key features of the sets included:<p>Color Scheme: The vehicles featured a striking red, white, and transparent green color scheme, which has remained an iconic look for LEGO Space themes.<p>Magnets: A core play feature was the use of a magnet crane system. Almost every vehicle was equipped with a functional magnetic crane arm to pick up cargo containers and energy crystals.<p>Modular Cargo: The red cargo containers were designed to be easily attached and detached from vehicles using the magnets, allowing for efficient loading and unloading.<p>Minifigures: The minifigures wore white uniforms with red and black accents, featuring a stylized "M" logo. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are now highly sought-after collector's items and are only available on the secondary market from re-sellers. <p>Mega Core Magnetizer (6989): The flagship set and main mobile base of operations, this large ship could separate into several smaller vessels and featured multiple magnetic cranes and a monorail-like transport system.<p>M:Tron Celestial Forager (6956): A ground-based rover and a small scout ship combined, featuring the magnetic crane system and large tires.<p>M:Tron Astro Explorer (6892): A ground vehicle with a large radar dish and the ability to transport a cargo container.
