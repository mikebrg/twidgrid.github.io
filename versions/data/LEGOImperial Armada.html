The LEGO Imperial Armada was a specific, short-lived sub-theme within the discontinued LEGO Pirates line, available only in 1996. It focused on the Spanish-style forces and structures, contrasting with the more generic "Imperial Guards" and "Imperial Soldiers" of other periods. <p>Theme Overview<p>The Imperial Armada was positioned as a distinct faction from the typical "Governors" forces. The minifigures wore unique armor with a Spanish Conquistador aesthetic, including ornate chest plates and distinctive helmets, and they operated galleon-style ships and island bases. <p>Color Scheme: The minifigures and structures featured dark blue, white, and a rare dark red color scheme.<p>Factions: They primarily acted as rivals to the generic Imperial Guard faction and were, of course, enemies of the classic LEGO Pirates and their leader, Captain Redbeard. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>Only five sets were produced under the Imperial Armada sub-theme, making them rare and highly sought-after collector's items. They are no longer available new from retailers and can only be found on the secondary market. <p>Armada Flagship (Set number: 6280): The largest and most iconic set, featuring a grand, multi-sail galleon ship and a crew of Armada soldiers.<p>Armada Port (Set number: 6262): A set depicting a small, fortified port or harbor with a small crane and a canon.<p>Armada Sentry (Set number: 6241): A small set featuring a lookout post built into a rock with a small boat and two minifigures.<p>Armada Trading Post (Set number: 6232): A very small, basic set with a trading post structure.
Armada Carts (Set number: 6204): The smallest set, featuring a small cart for transporting goods. <p>Related Themes<p>For fans of classic LEGO Pirates, the "Imperial Armada" offered a unique visual departure from the standard British-style forces. While the Armada theme is discontinued, the classic LEGO Pirates theme has seen two official revivals (in 2009 and 2015), which included the generic Imperial Guard and Governor minifigures. The current LEGO Icons Pirates of Barracuda Bay (set 21322), a large fan-designed homage to the original theme, also featured these classic Imperial Guard minifigures.
