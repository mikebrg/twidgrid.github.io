The LEGO Knights' Kingdom theme was a short-lived, discontinued line from 2000 that served as the primary LEGO Castle offering for that year. It featured a return to a more traditional medieval setting after the Ninja theme, focusing on a conflict between two factions. <p>Theme Overview<p>The 2000 Knights' Kingdom theme centered on a conflict between the Lion Knights, led by King Leo, and a group of outlaws called the Bulls, commanded by the villain Cedric the Bull. <p>Factions: The King's forces featured blue and yellow with a lion crest, while the Bulls used more rugged designs and had no central castle of their own.<p>Characters: This was the first Castle theme to feature a complete royal family, including King Leo, Queen Leonora, and Princess Storm, a unique feature for the time.<p>Design: Sets included new elements such as carved lion-head bricks and stained-glass window pieces for the castle, contrasting with the Bulls' siege engines and attack wagons. <p>Sets in the Collection<p>All sets for this theme were released within the single year of 2000 and are now only available through re-sellers. <p>King Leo's Castle (Set number: 6098): The main fortress for the Lion Knights, it included eight minifigures and various castle elements like a drawbridge and flags.<p>Bull's Attack (Set number: 6096): Featured a large, wheeled attack vehicle for Cedric the Bull's forces.<p>Royal Joust (Set number: 6095): A set depicting a jousting match with three minifigures, including King Leo and a Bull knight.<p>Guarded Treasury (Set number: 6094): A smaller set focused on a treasury and a simple defense.<p>Various Small Carts and Battle Stations: The theme also included numerous small, affordable sets like King Leo's Spear Cart (set 1286) and Weezil's Stone Bomber (set 1289). <p>Video Game Tie-in<p>A tie-in video game, LEGO Creator: Knights' Kingdom, was released for Microsoft Windows in October 2000. The game allowed players to build their own medieval kingdoms using virtual bricks based on the theme.
