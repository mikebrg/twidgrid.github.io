A LEGO Quatro brick is a discontinued building element designed for toddlers aged 1 to 3, produced from 2004 to 2006. The bricks are significantly larger than standard LEGO and DUPLO bricks but are cross-compatible with the latter. <p>Key Characteristics<p>Size: A Quatro brick is four times the length, height, and width of a standard LEGO brick, and twice the dimensions (length, height, width) of a DUPLO brick. In terms of volume, one 2x4 Quatro brick is the equivalent of 64 standard 2x4 LEGO bricks.<p>Material: The bricks are made of a slightly softer plastic than DUPLO to be easier for very young children to handle and to endure teething.<p>Compatibility: Quatro bricks are compatible with DUPLO bricks. You can place a DUPLO brick on top of a Quatro stud, and a Quatro brick can attach to the bottom of a DUPLO brick. This compatibility allows for a seamless transition as children grow from Quatro to DUPLO and eventually to the standard LEGO System bricks.<p>Availability: The product line was discontinued in 2006, with only 10 sets produced. They are no longer available for retail purchase but can be found through re-sellers. <p>Theme and Design<p>The Quatro line, initially part of the LEGO Explore series, featured simple, colorful bricks designed for early childhood development, promoting creativity and fine motor skills. The logo for the theme was a blue elephant, the same character used for the even larger, earlier Primo (or LEGO Baby) bricks, but in a different color.
