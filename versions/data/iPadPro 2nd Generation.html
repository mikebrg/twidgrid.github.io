iPad Pro 2nd Generation
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The second generation of iPad Pro is a line of iPad tablet computers developed and marketed by Apple Inc. The iPads, with 12.9 inch and 10.5 inch screens, were both announced on June 5, 2017. Both models are compatible with the first generation of Apple Pencil. Like the first generation, a larger size and stylus compatibility were a point of difference from the rest of Apple's available iPads.<p>Upgrades from the first-generation iPad Pro include the more powerful A10X Fusion chip, storage capacity up to 512 GB and the larger display of the 10.5 inch model (upgraded from a 9.7 inch model) while the 12.9 inch model was refreshed. Following the 2017 announcement, the first-generation models were discontinued.<p>The 12.9 inch version was discontinued on October 30, 2018, after the announcement of the 3rd-generation iPad Pro. However, the 10.5 inch version continued in production along with the 11 inch version until March 18, 2019, when the iPad Air (3rd generation) was announced.<p>Both second generation iPad Pro models supported eight versions of iOS/iPadOS, being iOS 10 through iPadOS 17. At WWDC 2024, it was announced that they would not support iPadOS 18 despite having superior hardware to some models supporting the new update.
