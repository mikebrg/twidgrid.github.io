LEGO Sloping roof tile bricks

LEGO introduced the first sloping roof tile bricks in 1958, the same year the iconic stud-and-tube patent was filed. These pieces were designed to build realistic gabled roofs for buildings in the new "LEGO System". <p>Design and Evolution<p>The introduction of dedicated roof pieces was a significant step toward creating a more versatile and realistic building system. <p>Initial Release (1958): The first sloped roof bricks were 45° angle pieces and included the 2x2 slope, 2x4 slope, 2x2 peak, and 2x4 peak. These were initially available in supplementary sets to expand a builder's collection.<p>Expansion (1960): An additional nine styles were released, providing a complete system for constructing complex and intersecting gabled roofs, along with new window and door systems.<p>Texture: The original slopes had a distinct, deep texture to make them look more like real roof tiles. Over the decades, the texturing was changed, removed, and eventually brought back due to fan demand, but the core design has remained consistent.<p>Modern Slopes ("Cheese Slopes"): Today, the range of slopes has expanded exponentially to include various angles (e.g., 33°) and the popular small 1x1x2/3 slope (nicknamed "cheese slope"), used extensively for detailed modern building techniques and vehicle shaping. <p>These pieces continue to be essential components in modern LEGO building, used for roofs, vehicle bodies, rock formations, and angled walls.
