The LEGO Legends of Chima theme ran from 2013 to 2015 and was a fantasy world inhabited by warring tribes of anthropomorphic animals battling for control of a powerful energy source called "Chi". The theme included construction sets, a popular animated TV series, video games, and theme park attractions. <p>Overview<p>The narrative of Legends of Chima centered on a pristine, natural paradise that became a battleground when a misunderstanding challenged the friendship between Prince Laval of the Lion tribe and Prince Cragger of the Crocodile tribe. The conflict escalated, and the various animal tribes went to war over the distribution of Chi, a resource that powers their vehicles, machinery, and themselves. <p>Factions and Tribes<p>The world of Chima was home to numerous animal tribes. The main factions were: <p>Protagonists: The initial "hero" tribes included the Lions, Eagles, Gorillas, and Bears, who allied to defend the balance of Chi.<p>Antagonists: The initial opposing tribes were the Crocodiles, Wolves, and Ravens, who sought to take control of the Chi supply.<p>Later Additions: As the storyline evolved through different seasons and product waves ("Quest for the Legend Beasts" and "Fire vs. Ice"), new tribes were introduced, including the Scorpion, Spider, Bat, Phoenix, Tiger, Saber-Tooth Tiger (Hunters), Mammoth, Vulture, and Ice Bear tribes. <p>Product Lines<p>The theme produced a variety of sets and media:<p>Playsets: Richly detailed building sets were released, featuring animal-themed vehicles and structures like the large Lion CHI Temple (70005) and the Flying Phoenix Fire Temple (70146), which often had action features.<p>Speedorz: A prominent feature of the theme was the "Speedorz" line of sets, which used a rip-cord mechanism to power a single-wheeled vehicle for competitive, challenge-based play.<p>Constructible Action Figures: Similar in style to the LEGO Hero Factory line, these figures allowed builders to create larger, articulated versions of characters like Laval and Cragger.<p>Video Games: Multiple games extended the world of Chima, including the racing game Legends of Chima: Speedorz and the MMORPG LEGO Legends of Chima Online, which have since been discontinued.<p>Animated Series: A 3D animated television series was produced in parallel with the toy line, running for three seasons and providing the driving narrative for the sets. <p>The theme was eventually discontinued in 2015 as LEGO shifted its focus to other "big bang" themes, such as Nexo Knights.
