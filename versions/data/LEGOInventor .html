Physical "Inventor" Sets (Discontinued)<p>In 2003, LEGO also introduced a physical product line called "Inventor" as a sub-theme within the broader LEGO Creator line. These sets were designed to encourage creativity and exploration. <p>Focus: The sets provided a versatile assortment of bricks and a booklet with multiple building ideas and concepts, rather than a single set of step-by-step instructions.<p>Key Feature: Some sets in this line incorporated battery-powered motors and wind-up bricks to introduce simple motion and mechanics into the builds.<p>Examples from 2003:<p>Motion Madness (Set number: 4090)<p>Micro Wheels (Set number: 4096)<p>Little Creations (Set number: 4401)<p>Fun with Bricks (Set number: 4087) <p>Both the software and the physical sets were aimed at enhancing the creative design process for LEGO fans. The modern equivalent of the LDD software is BrickLink Studio, which is the current official platform for digital LEGO building.
