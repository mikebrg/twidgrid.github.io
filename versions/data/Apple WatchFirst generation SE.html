At its September 2020 product introduction event, Apple also announced the Apple Watch SE, a lower-cost model, similar to the iPhone SE. The SE incorporates the same always-on altimeter as the Series 6, but uses the previous-generation S5 processor and previous- (i.e. second) generation optical heart rate sensor; does not include ECG and blood oximeter sensors or an always-on display; and does not include ultra-wideband (UWB) or 5 GHz Wi-Fi communication capabilities.
<p>
The first-generation Apple Watch SE was discontinued following the release of the second-generation Apple Watch SE in 2022.
<p>
Software support for the Apple Watch Series 4, Series 5, and the first-generation Apple Watch SE ended with watchOS 10.6.1.
