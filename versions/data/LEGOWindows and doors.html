LEGO Windows and doors
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
In 1954, the LEGO Group introduced dedicated window and door pieces as part of their new "System in Play" concept. These early pieces allowed for more realistic buildings and were sold in various sets, including the supplemental pack 700/c. <p>Design and Features of 1954 Windows and Doors<p>The 1954 windows and doors were a specific generation of parts that preceded the more familiar designs of the late 1950s and 1960s. <p>Attachment Method: These parts were designed to fit into the slots of the "Automatic Binding Bricks" of that era. They had small "wings" on their sides that would slide into the brick slots for support, rather than using the stud-and-tube coupling system introduced later in 1958.<p>Scale: This version corresponded to a circa 1:83 scale for the "System i Leg".<p>"Glass" Inserts: Some variations, like those in the 700/C sets, included transparent "glass" pieces that slid into the frame.<p>Colors: They were available in colors such as white, red, and blue.<p>Lack of Studs on Top: The fixtures did not have studs on their top surface, which meant bricks couldn't be attached directly on top of them. <p>1954 Sets and Availability <p>These window and door pieces were available both as individual/supplemental items (Product Number 700/c) and included within various "Gift Packages" (Lego Mursten) for the Town Plan theme. <p>Supplemental Set 700/C: This pack offered a variety of different window and door types, including a tall classic window (1x6x4), a door (1x2x4), and three-pane windows (1x6x3).<p>Gift Packages: Sets with item numbers like 700-3 included bricks for building, and could be supplemented with the window and door packs to create detailed structures. <p>These pieces were an important step in the evolution of the LEGO System, allowing for more realistic architectural models before the standardization of the brick design in 1958.
