LEGO Expert Series sets
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
In 1975, LEGO introduced the "Expert Series" with highly detailed, brick-built vehicle models aimed at older, more experienced builders. These sets were precursors to the technically advanced "Expert Builder" line (later Technic) that would launch in 1977. <p>1975 "Expert Series" (Hobby Sets)<p>The 1975 sets are part of what is often referred to by collectors as the "Hobby Sets" sub-theme. They were notable for their scale and use of standard bricks to create realistic representations of classic automobiles. <p>LEGO 390 1913 Cadillac: A detailed red model of the vintage car, one of the primary sets in the initial release.<p>LEGO 391 1926 Renault: A model of the classic blue Renault, another core offering of the series.<p>LEGO 392 Formula 1: A blue racing car model, which provided a different aesthetic compared to the classic cars.<p>Other Vehicles: The series was later expanded with other branded vehicles like a Norton commando motorcycle and a Harley Davidson police bike. <p>Key Characteristics<p>Detail-Oriented: The focus was on aesthetic realism using only standard LEGO bricks and plates for all components, including the wheels.<p>Target Audience: These sets were specifically marketed towards older children and adults, with the inner boxes even doubling as display stands, indicating their purpose as models rather than active play toys.<p>Building Experience: They were more complex than typical LEGOLAND sets of the time, requiring more steps and pieces to complete. <p>While these 1975 sets didn't feature the gears, axles, and technical functions that defined the Expert Builder line two years later, they established the concept of a more challenging, expert-level building experience for the brand.
