Launched in October 2024, Photoshop 2025 unveiled a new era of generative editing and photorealism:
<p>
Distraction Removal with Remove tool: Automatically identifies and erases wires, cables, and even people using AI. You can toggle generative assist — Auto, On, or Off — depending on your editing needs. 
<p>
Firefly-powered Generative Tools: Generative Fill, Expand, and Full Image generation now leverage the latest Firefly Image Model for richer images, better prompt interpretation, and creative flexibility. 
<p>
Generate Similar: Create alternate versions from existing generative results — a quick way to explore creative variations. 
<p>
Generate Background: Replace or create matching backgrounds that seamlessly match lighting and perspective of your subject. 
<p>
HDR Workflow with OCIO & 32-bit support: Better color control via OpenColorIO, plus expanded tool compatibility for 32-bit HDR editing—no more fallback to 16/8-bit. 
<p>
Improved Font Browser: Searchable Adobe Fonts with variable font support and intuitive filtering. 
<p>
v26.1 (November 2024) A sleeker interface tip, more utility:
<p>
Gradient Contextual Task Bar: When using the Gradient tool, you can now toggle presets, types (Linear, Reflected, Diamond), reverse colors, and tweak opacity—all from the Contextual Task Bar. 
<p>
v26.5 (March 2025) Workflow polish to keep things moving:
<p>
Revamped Adjustment Presets Layout: Fresh tabbed design with drag-and-drop organization and group support for your favorite presets. 
<p>
v26.6 (April 2025) Stepping up AI control and precision:
<p>
Select Details in Object Selection: Hover over subjects to auto-select features like eyes, hair, clothing—great for fine edits like changing eye color or styling hair. 
<p>
Generate Image with Composition Reference: Firefly now lets you use a reference image to influence layout or pose of newly generated content. 
<p>
On-canvas Color Adjustment ("Adjust Colors"): In-context HSL sliders—adjust either prominent colors or picked tones without jumping to panels. 
<p>
Cloud Processing for Select Subject / Remove Background: Off-load heavy selections to Adobe’s cloud for cleaner, faster results around tricky edges like hair or fur. 
<p>
Beta Actions Panel: Now suggests multi-step edits you can preview or apply—think AI-assisted macros. 
<p>v26.8 (June 2025 – released June 17, 2025) Text, format, and web-friendly boosts:
<p>
Dynamic Text: Text intelligently resizes, reflows, and reformats to fit boxes—even with mixed fonts and styles. Handily adjusts layout as you modify the box. 
<p>
AVIF & JPEG XL Support: Open, edit, and save in modern formats that offer HDR, efficient compression, and great web performance. 
<p>
UI & Stability Enhancements: Smooth workflow gains, especially in adjustment presets access. 
<p>v26.9 (July 2025 – released July 29, 2025) AI-savvy, collaborative, and output intelligence:
<p>
Remove via Contextual Task Bar: Now smarter and non-destructive, on a new pixel layer with upgraded generative AI for cleaner deletions. 
<p>
Choose Firefly Model: Select your preferred Firefly model when using Generative Fill/Expand; version tracking appears in Properties panel. 
<p>
Share to Apps: Send images directly to tools like Mail or Slack with your chosen format and resolution. 
<p>
Photoshop on iPhone – "Harmonize" feature: Blend subjects into backgrounds seamlessly (plus Showroom between desktop and iPhone editing). 
<p>
Performance & Bug Fixes: General speed-ups, especially around move tool/gradient/scripting quirks.
