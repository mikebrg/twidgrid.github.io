The LEGO Exo-Force theme is a discontinued product line from 2006 to 2008 that centered on human pilots using large, anime-inspired battle mechs to fight a robot rebellion on Sentai Mountain. The sets are no longer in production but can be acquired through re-sellers. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>Inspired by Japanese manga and anime, the Exo-Force story was detailed in an online comic and a series of books. The narrative followed an elite team of human pilots defending their home, Sentai Fortress, from a robot army led by Meca One, who had turned the once peaceful worker robots against their creators. <p>The story progressed through several phases:<p>2006: The Battle of Sentai Fortress: The initial conflict where the humans narrowly defend their base against an all-out robot assault.<p>2007: The Golden City: The humans search for the legendary Golden City at the top of the mountain to find powerful, ancient technology to defeat the robots.<p>2008: Deep Jungle: The robots conquer the northern side of the mountain and capture the human leader, Sensei Keiken. The remaining pilots launch a rescue mission into the jungle environment where the robots originated. <p>The story was discontinued before it was resolved, as sales did not meet expectations in 2007-2008. <p>Key Characters<p>The theme featured human minifigures with a unique anime-style design and brightly colored hair. <p>Takeshi: The pilot of the Grand Titan (set 7701) and Assault Tiger (set 8113).<p>Hikaru: Pilot of the Stealth Hunter (set 7700) and Sky Guardian (set 8103).<p>Ryo: Pilot of the Mobile Defense Tank (set 7706) and Hybrid Rescue Tank (set 8118).<p>Ha-Ya-To: Pilot of the Gate Defender from the Gate Assault (set 7705) and Aero Booster (set 8106).<p>Sensei Keiken: The leader of the Exo-Force team and one of the creators of the robots.<p>Meca One: The golden robot leader of the robot rebellion.<p>Devastators/Iron Drones: The silver and copper-colored robot army. <p>Notable Sets<p>The sets' main feature was the large, poseable mechs using Technic joints, with some 2006 sets incorporating light-up power cores and fiber-optic cables to "power" their weapons. <p>Sentai Fortress (Set number: 7709): The humans' main base on Sentai Mountain, the largest set of the 2006 wave.<p>Striking Venom (Set number: 7707): Meca One's large battle station in the form of a mechanical snake.<p>Mobile Devastator (Set number: 8108): A massive rolling robot base for Meca One and his troops from the 2007 wave.<p>Bridge Walker vs. White Lightning (Set number: 7713): A popular set featuring two competing mechs controlled by the human Ha-Ya-To and Meca One.
