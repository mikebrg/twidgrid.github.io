LEGO uses a combination of classic yellow and several realistic "flesh" tones for minifigures. The choice of color generally depends on whether the set is an in-house, non-licensed theme or part of a licensed intellectual property (IP). <p>Classic Yellow<p>The vast majority of minifigures in LEGO's own themes (like City, Castle, Space, Ninjago, and Collectible Minifigures) use a neutral yellow for their skin color. <p>Purpose: LEGO originally chose yellow in the 1970s to be ethnically neutral, allowing children from all backgrounds to imagine themselves as the character without specific ethnic association. <p>Realistic "Flesh" Tones<p>In 2003, LEGO introduced naturalistic skin tones for licensed products to more closely resemble the real-life actors and characters they were based on. <p>Usage: These colors are used in licensed themes such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel, DC Super Heroes, and Indiana Jones.<p>Color Names: The current range of human skin tones includes:<p>Light Nougat (the most dominant "white" skin tone)<p>Nougat<p>Medium Nougat<p>Reddish <p>Brown<p>Medium Brown (introduced 2022)<p>Medium Tan (Warm Tan, introduced 2022)<p>Sienna Brown (introduced 2024)<p>Umber Brown (introduced 2024) <p>Other Themes and Exceptions<p>DUPLO & Friends: Figures in the DUPLO (since the 1980s) and Friends (since 2012) themes have also used a variety of realistic skin tones, often with a wider range of diversity than some licensed themes.<p>Other Colors: Non-human characters (aliens, monsters, droids, etc.) have been produced in numerous other colors including black, brown (retired and replaced by reddish brown), sand green, dark azure, and various transparent colors.
