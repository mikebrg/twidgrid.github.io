LEGO Brick Sketches
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The LEGO Brick Sketches theme has been discontinued. It featured brick-built portraits of iconic pop culture characters, designed to be hung on a wall or displayed on a desk. The theme was originally inspired by the work of LEGO designer Chris McVeigh. The last sets in the line were released in 2022, and the theme was phased out afterward due to low sales. <p>Because these sets are retired, they are no longer sold directly by LEGO. You will need to find them through secondary markets or retailers with remaining inventory. <p>Retired sets (2020)<p>LEGO Brick Sketches Batman (40386): A portrait of the DC Comics superhero.<p>LEGO Brick Sketches The Joker (40428): A portrait of the Batman villain.<p>LEGO Brick Sketches First Order Stormtrooper (40391): A portrait of the Star Wars character.<p>LEGO Brick Sketches BB-8 (40431): A portrait of the droid from Star Wars. <p>Retired sets (2021)<p>LEGO Brick Sketches Mickey Mouse (40456): A portrait of the classic Disney character.<p>LEGO Brick Sketches Minnie Mouse (40457): A portrait of the classic Disney character. <p>Retired sets (2022)<p>LEGO Brick Sketches Iron Man (40535): A portrait of the Marvel superhero.<p>LEGO Brick Sketches Miles Morales (40536): A portrait of the Marvel superhero from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. <p>Where to find Brick Sketches<p>eBay: You can find many retired sets, both new and used, from various sellers.<p>BrickLink: This is a large marketplace for LEGO parts and sets, including retired ones.<p>Brick resale shops: Some specialty shops may have remaining stock of these retired products.
