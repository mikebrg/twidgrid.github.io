The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are smartphones that were designed, developed, and marketed by Apple. They are the ninth generation of the iPhone. They were announced on September 9, 2015, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco by Apple CEO Tim Cook, with pre-orders beginning September 12 and official release on September 25, 2015. They were succeeded by the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus on September 7, 2016 and were discontinued with the announcement of the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR on September 12, 2018.<p>The iPhone 6s has a similar design to the iPhone 6 but includes updated hardware, including a strengthened 7000 series aluminum alloy chassis and upgraded Apple A9 system-on-chip, a new 12-megapixel rear camera that can record up to 4K video at 30fps (A first in the series), can take dynamic "Live Photos", the first increase in front camera photo resolution since the 2012 iPhone 5, and also features for the first time front facing "Retina Flash" which brightens up the display three times of its highest possible brightness for selfies, 2nd generation Touch ID fingerprint recognition sensor, LTE Advanced support, and "Hey Siri" capabilities without needing to be plugged in. The iPhone 6s also introduces a new hardware feature known as "3D Touch", which enables pressure-sensitive touch inputs. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are also the first smartphones to use the fastest high end flash storage NVM Express (NVMe). The 6s and 6s Plus, alongside the iPhone XS and XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max are the longest supported iPhones ever released, through seven major versions of iOS from iOS 9 to iOS 15. They do not support iOS 16 due to hardware limitations.
