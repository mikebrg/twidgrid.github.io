The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. Serving as Apple's flagship models of the 13th generation of iPhones, they succeeded the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, respectively, upon their release. Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the devices alongside the standard model, the iPhone 11, on September 10, 2019 at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park. Pre-orders began on September 13, 2019, and the phones went on sale on September 20. They were discontinued on October 13, 2020, following the announcement of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro.<p>Notable improvements over the previous devices include the triple-lens rear camera system and the A13 Bionic chip. The 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max are Apple's first iPhones to feature a "Pro" designation, previously used only for larger Apple devices, such as the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. They are also the first generation of iPhones that include a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box, which allows them to connect to a charger brick or to a Mac computer that only has USB-C ports, the only generation that included an 18-watt, "fast-charging" power adapter in the box, and the last generation that included the power adapter in the box (as well as EarPods).
