The LEGO Aquazone theme was a popular, multi-faction, discontinued product line that ran from 1995 to 1999. It focused on a futuristic, underwater world where different groups of divers and villains battled for control of valuable "hydro-crystals" at the bottom of the ocean. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The world of Aquazone was divided into several sub-themes, each representing a different faction with a unique color scheme and motivation: <p>Aquanauts (1995): The first faction; they were the "good guy" explorers and scientists in bright blue and black who discovered the hydro-crystals and sought to study them peacefully.<p>Aquasharks (1995): The villainous faction in black and gray, led by the minifigure "Shark", who wanted to steal the crystals for their own power.<p>Aquacessories (1996): Small, supplemental sets for the other themes.<p>Aquaraiders I (1997): A single, neutral faction that focused solely on mining the crystals.<p>Hydronauts (1998): The final "good guy" faction, a more advanced team focused on deep-sea missions.<p>Aquasharks II / Stingrays (1998-1999): The final villain faction with new designs and color schemes. <p>Key Product Features<p>Hydro-Crystals: These were small, often transparent or trans-neon green "gem" pieces that were the collectible focus of the theme.<p>Minifigures: The divers featured unique helmet designs with visors and breathing apparatus, often with detailed torso printing.<p>Vehicles: The sets included a wide range of submarines and underwater vehicles, many with a modular design, robot arms, or cargo bays to hold the crystals.<p>Animals: The sets were known for including various new and rare sea animal molds. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are no longer available new from retailers but can be found on the secondary market.<p>Aquanaut's Base (Set number: 6195): The flagship set for the first "good guy" faction, it featured an extensive underwater research facility and dock.<p>Aquashark's Citadel (Set number: 6196): The main villain base for the original Aquasharks, it included a large ship/base and several vehicles.<p>Command Sub (Set number: 6198): The largest set for the Hydronauts faction, a large submarine with modular features and a separate mini-sub.<p>Crystal Explorer Sub (Set number: 6175): A popular, early Aquanauts set featuring a core sub design. <p>Successor Themes<p>For fans of the underwater theme, LEGO later released:<p>Divers (1997): A more realistic, non-sci-fi theme focused on present-day exploration.<p>Aqua Raiders (2007): A standalone theme focused on fighting sea monsters for treasure.<p>Atlantis (2010-2011): A theme where divers explored the lost city and battled sea creatures.<p>LEGO City Deep Sea Explorers (Current): The modern, realistic exploration theme that is widely available today.
