The GoPro Wide HERO was the first model with a 170° wide-angle lens. It was released in 2008 alongside the Digital HERO5 and had the same 5 MP sensor (2592×1944), capable of 512×384 at 30 fps video with sound recording (up to 56 min. on a 2 GB SD card), 5 MP Photos, 10 s self-timer, 3× sequence still photo burst and Auto "Photo every 2 or 5 seconds" mode. It was powered by 2 × AAA batteries (not included in the box).<p>The Wide HERO was marketed with the basic camera and housing alone, or bundled with accessories (as the Surf HERO, Motorsports HERO Wide, or Helmet HERO Wide). The camera was later renamed the SD HERO 170 to emphasize the differences with the succeeding HD HERO second-generation cameras.
