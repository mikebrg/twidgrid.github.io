The most famous "LEGO Duck" is the iconic wooden pull-along toy, one of the very first products manufactured by the company, a brick-built version of which is available as an exclusive set. Otherwise, LEGO does not produce a specific, singular "duck" piece, but rather buildable figures using standard bricks. <p>The Iconic Wooden Duck<p>The original wooden duck is one of the most significant items in LEGO history, produced from 1935 to 1960. It featured a mechanism where the beak opened and closed as it was pulled along on its wheels. <p>LEGO House Exclusive (40501 The Wooden Duck): As a tribute to its heritage, LEGO released a 621-piece brick-built replica of the wooden duck. This display model is an exclusive, limited-edition product only available for purchase at the LEGO House in Billund, Denmark.<p>Significance: The original toy and a related story about quality control inspired the company motto, "Only the best is good enough". <p>Buildable LEGO Duck Options<p>For building ducks with the LEGO system, several options exist:<p>Official Instructions: LEGO provides free official building instructions online for creating a simple yellow duck using a small assortment of basic bricks.<p>Polybag Set (30541 Build a Duck): A small polybag set was released that provides the handful of bricks needed to build a basic duck, along with instructions to build other small animals.<p>LEGO Serious Play (6 Brick Challenge): The concept of building a "duck" using just six specific bricks is a popular activity used in the LEGO Serious Play methodology workshops. It demonstrates how different people can create varied solutions from the same limited parts.<p>Licensed Characters: LEGO has produced buildable figures of specific duck characters, most notably the LEGO BrickHeadz Donald Duck (40377), which is a stylized, collectible model of the classic Disney character.
