LEGO Expert Builder was the original name for the advanced line of sets launched in 1977 that focused on mechanical principles and realistic functionality. The theme was later rebranded as LEGO Technic in 1984. <p>History and Evolution<p>Introduction: The "Expert Builder" series was introduced in 1977, aimed at older builders who wanted more complex, functional models.<p>Renaming: In 1984, LEGO officially renamed the line to "Technic," the name it is known by today.<p>Purpose: The line was designed to allow the construction of working vehicles and machines that went beyond the basic brick-building properties of normal LEGO. It served as a way for builders to learn basic principles of mechanical engineering. <p>Key Characteristics<p>Unlike standard LEGO sets, Expert Builder sets utilized a different building style and specialized parts. <p>Specialized Pieces: The theme introduced new elements like interconnecting plastic rods, gears, axles, cogs, and universal joints.<p>Functionality: Models featured realistic, working functions such as rack and pinion steering, life-like engine movements (moving pistons), and complex gear systems.<p>Building Style: Early sets were an adaptation of the regular LEGO System but quickly evolved to use more advanced, specialized components as the theme matured. The models often resembled real-world machinery and vehicles, such as tractors and car chassis. <p>Notable Early Sets<p>The first Expert Builder sets from the launch year defined the core concepts for the future Technic theme: <p>LEGO 851 (or 952) Tractor: A detailed replica of a vintage Massey Ferguson, praised by reviewers on Brickset for its functionality, including a working harrow that spun when lowered.<p>LEGO 853 (or 956) Car Chassis: A popular set that included functional rack and pinion steering and a detailed engine with moving pistons, allowing builders to see internal mechanics at work.<p>LEGO 852 (or 954) Helicopter: A complex model that featured geared main and tail rotors, and a tilting mechanism operated by levers.
