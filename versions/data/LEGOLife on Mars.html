The LEGO Life on Mars theme was a short-lived, discontinued product line from 2001 to 2002 that was part of the LEGO Space universe. The theme focused on peaceful exploration and discovery, rather than conflict, between human astronauts and friendly native Martians. <p>Theme Overview and Story<p>The storyline, a sequel to the 1999 Space Port theme, followed a group of human astronauts who landed on Mars and discovered an intelligent Martian civilization. In contrast to the later Mars Mission theme, the humans were primarily interested in observation and helping the Martians deal with internal issues, such as a rebel faction, rather than engaging in a war over resources. <p>A unique feature of the sets was their modular design and use of a "pump system" which could transport pods containing minifigures or "Biodium" (the Martians' crucial energy mineral) through tubes. <p>Key Discontinued Sets<p>The theme included a variety of sets featuring human vehicles (white and orange) and Martian mechs. The larger sets could be combined into alternate forms. 
Aero Tube Hanger (Set number: 7317): The largest set, featuring a hangar with a functional pump-and-tube transportation system for minifigure pods.<p>Excavation Searcher (Set number: 7316): A large human vehicle designed for mining the surface, which could split into smaller crafts.<p>Solar Explorer (Set number: 7315): The human's main rocket ship which could convert into a lab and a mini-rocket.<p>Recon-Mech RP (Set number: 7314): One of the larger Martian mechs that could convert into different forms.<p>Red Planet Protector (Set number: 7313): Another human vehicle, designed for defense, with a drill and a crane. <p>Related Themes<p>Space Port (1999): The present-day themed predecessor, featuring the origins of the human characters' mission to Mars.<p>Mars Mission (2007-2009): A later, unrelated Mars theme that focused on a war between humans and hostile aliens over energy crystals.<p>LEGO City Space (Current): Modern space-themed sets within the LEGO City line are inspired by real-world NASA missions and focus on exploration.
