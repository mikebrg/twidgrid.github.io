The LEGO Indiana Jones theme is a licensed product line based on the film franchise, which has seen two main runs: an original wave from 2008 to 2009 and a brief return in 2023. The sets recreate iconic scenes and include minifigures of key characters from the movies. <p>History and Overview<p>Original Run: The theme was first introduced in 2008 and included sets from the original trilogy films (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), as well as sets for the then-new Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<p>Video Games: The franchise inspired two popular video games: LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures (2008), covering the first three films, and LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues (2009), which included all four films and a level editor mode.<p>2023 Relaunch: The theme was revived in April 2023 with three new sets based on Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. A planned fourth set based on The Temple of Doom was canceled shortly before release.<p>Status: The 2023 sets were discontinued by the end of 2024, making the entire theme retired for now. <p>Notable Sets<p>The theme features a variety of sets, from small vehicle chases to detailed temple models. <p>Temple Escape (7623, 77015): The iconic boulder run scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark has been produced in two versions, the latter being a large 18+ display model with interactive functions.<p>Ambush In Cairo (7195): A set from the 2009 wave based on the marketplace scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark, including the Cairo Swordsman minifigure.<p>Venice Canal Chase (7199, 77012): This set recreates the speedboat chase from The Last Crusade, with a more modern version released in 2023.<p>Fighter Plane Chase (77012): Features a detailed plane and car for the chase sequence in The Last Crusade.<p>Escape from the Lost Tomb (77013): A set from 2023 that depicts the Well of Souls scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, complete with a light-up Ark of the Covenant and snake elements. <p>Collectibility<p>All LEGO Indiana Jones sets are retired and no longer available in standard retail stores. They are considered highly collectible, especially the larger, detailed models and figures of key characters like Dr. Henry Jones Sr. and Marion Ravenwood. Secondary marketplaces such as eBay and BrickLink are the primary sources for these items.
