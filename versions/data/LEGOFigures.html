In 1974, the LEGO Group introduced its very first figures designed to interact with the broader LEGO System sets, a major milestone in the company's history. These early figures were significantly different from the modern minifigure. <p>"Homemaker" Figures (1974)<p>These figures, which collectors now call "Homemaker" figures (or sometimes "Pre-Minifigs" or "Maxifigs"), were a response to the need for characters to populate the LEGO houses and domestic sets of the time. <p>Design: The figures were large, brick-built characters made of solid blocks of plastic for the body and legs. The torso and head pieces were specialized molded parts that could not be taken apart.<p>Scale: They were much larger than the later minifigure, standing around 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) tall.<p>Articulation: They had limited articulation; their arms could swing up and down, and the hands (which looked like standard LEGO C-shaped hands) could swivel.<p>Lack of Minifigure Features: They did not have the ability to sit, nor did they use the "stud-and-tube" connection system to attach to standard LEGO studs like modern figures. They were simply placed next to or inside vehicles and buildings.<p>Appearance: They featured simple, molded faces (sometimes just black dots for eyes) and came in various roles such as mothers, fathers, police officers, and doctors. <p>Key Sets Featuring the 1974 Figures<p>These figures were integrated into several "LEGOLAND" themed sets, primarily those focused on domestic and town life: <p>LEGO Set 200/203/205 Homemaker Sets: A series of simple sets that included one figure and basic furniture or a vehicle.<p>LEGO Set 540 "Furniture with 2 Figures": One of the core sets that introduced these figures to the North American market.<p>LEGO Set 560 "Family Car": This set included two figures and a simple car designed to fit them. <p>The Homemaker figures remained in production until 1982, coexisting with the much more popular modern minifigure, which was introduced in 1978 and eventually replaced them entirely.
