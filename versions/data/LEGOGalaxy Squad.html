LEGO Galaxy Squad was a space-themed line of construction toys released in January 2013 that focused on a team of human and robot heroes battling an alien bug invasion across the galaxy. The theme continued the storyline from LEGO Monster Fighters and was followed by LEGO Ultra Agents. <p>Factions and Teams<p>The theme centered around two primary factions: the heroic Galaxy Squad and the evil Alien Buggoids. The Galaxy Squad was comprised of four specialized, color-coded task forces, each with specific skills. <p>Galaxy Squad Teams<p>Blue Team: Led by veteran Solomon Blaze and including Max Solarflare and a Blue Robot Sidekick, this team specialized in strategy and technology, often using the largest vehicles.<p>Red Team: Focused purely on speed, this team consisted of Billy Starbeam and a Red Robot Sidekick, utilizing small, fast vehicles.<p>Green Team: Specializing in defense and heavy artillery, this team included Chuck Stonebreaker and a Green Robot Sidekick.<p>Orange Team: This team's main tactic was firepower, led by Jack Fireblade and Ashlee Starstrider (the only human female in the theme), alongside an Orange Robot Sidekick. <p>Alien Buggoids<p>The villains were insectoid aliens known as Buggoids, Mosquitoids, and Mantizoids, who captured civilians in cocoons and turned planets into hives. Their vehicles resembled the insects they were based on, such as a mosquito (Warp Stinger) or a mantis (Star Slicer). <p>Key Features and Sets<p>The theme included 10 main sets and two polybags, with all hero vehicles sharing a white color scheme with team-specific accents. <p>Transforming Vehicles: A key feature was the ability of many Galaxy Squad vehicles to split into two or more smaller, separate vehicles for different tactical situations.<p>Continuation of Lore: The storyline provided a rare continuity between different LEGO themes, linking the light beam from the Monster Fighters castle as the signal that attracted the aliens.<p>Notable Sets: Popular sets included the Vermin Vaporizer (70704) with its mech function, the massive Galactic Titan (70709), and the Bug Obliterator (70705). <p>The theme concluded its run by the end of 2013 and is now a retired, highly regarded collector's item.
