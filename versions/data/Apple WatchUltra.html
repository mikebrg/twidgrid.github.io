The Apple Watch Ultra is a new high-end model which Apple positioned towards endurance athletes and outdoor recreation (competing with offerings from companies such as Garmin and Polar); it shares most of its hardware with the Series 8, but it has a larger display and 49 mm band, a rugged titanium casing, a brighter display with a flat front crystal, an additional "Action" button that can be mapped to different apps and functions, integrated multi-band GPS, a water temperature sensor, and a larger battery which Apple rated at 36 hours of usage without using power saving modes.
