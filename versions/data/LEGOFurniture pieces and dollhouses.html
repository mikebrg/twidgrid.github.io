LEGO Furniture pieces and dollhouses
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
In 1971, LEGO began specifically targeting girls by introducing the "Homemaker" theme, which included dedicated furniture pieces and dollhouse sets. These sets provided a dollhouse-like play experience using specialized, pre-molded pieces alongside standard bricks. <p>1971 Homemaker Sets<p>The initial 1971 release focused on specific rooms of a house, which could be built on provided baseplates. <p>LEGO Set 260 Doll's Living Room: This set focused on a lounge area and included furniture like a sofa and chairs.<p>LEGO Set 261 Kitchen: This set provided a full kitchen setup with molded and printed pieces depicting appliances and cabinetry.<p>LEGO 344 Bungalow: A set that included a complete house structure, featuring some of the new furniture pieces and a vehicle.<p>LEGO 380 Village Set: An ultra-rare, large set released in 1971 that contained several smaller sets within a special box, including residential buildings with furniture options.<p>LEGO 350 Spanish Villa House: Another set that offered a residential building experience, including house elements and potentially some basic furniture configurations. <p>Furniture Pieces and Figures<p>The furniture in these sets was created using both standard LEGO bricks and specialized, single-purpose pieces. <p>Molded Pieces: LEGO introduced specific molded pieces like curved sofas, chairs, and kitchen appliances, some of which had printed details to enhance realism.<p>Baseplates: The earliest sets came with fully studded baseplates, later replaced by a design with studs only around the edge to allow for more flexible furniture placement and building.<p>Figures: These sets often came with the non-posable, brick-built "Homemaker" figures (introduced in 1974) to populate the houses and interact with the furniture. <p>This theme was a key step in LEGO's history of creating theme-based play sets that went beyond basic free-building, allowing children to build detailed environments for role-playing domestic scenarios.
