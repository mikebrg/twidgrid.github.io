The LEGO Brick Separator is a small, versatile plastic tool designed to help pry apart tightly connected LEGO bricks, plates, and tiles without straining fingers or damaging pieces. It is often included in medium to large sets and is also available for individual purchase. <p>Design and Variations<p>The brick separator has evolved through two primary designs: <p>Original Design (1990-2011): This version was larger and bulkier, primarily available in old dark gray and green.<p>Updated Design (2011-Present): The current version is slimmer and more compact, offering added functionality for removing various piece types. It is most commonly found in bright orange, but has also appeared in other rare colors such as green (in two specific sets) and teal (dark turquoise). <p>How to Use the Tool<p>The brick separator is a multi-functional tool with features for different separation needs: <p>Prying Plates (Leverage): The main function uses an angled edge to act as a lever. You can either press the front studs of the separator onto a larger brick and push down on the back handle to lift a plate off a base, or slide the separator under a plate and lift the handle up to pop the piece off.<p>Removing Tiles: The flat edge (the side with the "LEGO" logo) can be slid into the space between a tile and the underlying studs, then pressed down to lever the tile free.
Removing Technic Axles: The top of the tool features a T-segment that fits into a Technic cross-hole. Pushing it in will force an axle out the other side. <p>Availability<p>The current LEGO Classic Brick Separator (630) in orange is widely available and can be purchased from various retailers and the official LEGO shop.
