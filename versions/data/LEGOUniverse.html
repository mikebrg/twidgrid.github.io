LEGO Universe was a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) that ran from October 26, 2010, to January 31, 2012. Developed by NetDevil, it was the first and only attempt by The LEGO Group to create a full-scale virtual world where players could build, explore, and battle. <p>Game Overview<p>The premise of the game centered around the battle against the Maelstrom, a chaotic force that was destroying creativity in the universe. Players created custom minifigure characters and joined one of four factions (The Assembly, The Venture League, The Sentinels, and Paradox) to restore balance. <p>Building Mechanics: A core feature was the robust building system, allowing players to create custom models brick by brick using a vast digital library of parts and colors. These creations could be used in the game, such as race cars or spaceships for travel between worlds.<p>Worlds: Players could explore various worlds with unique themes, including the pirate-themed Gnarled Forest, the high-tech Nimbus Station, and a Ninjago-themed area called Forbidden Valley.<p>Factions: Players aligned with different factions that embodied different aspects of creativity: the builders (Assembly), the explorers (Venture League), the protectors (Sentinels), and those who harnessed the Maelstrom's power (Paradox). <p>Physical LEGO Sets<p>To promote the game, The LEGO Group released a few physical sets and promotional items: <p>LEGO Universe Rocket (55001): A small, polybag-style rocket model.<p>LEGO Universe Nexus Astronaut Minifigure: An exclusive minifigure included with the game's pre-order physical edition, which granted early access and an in-game code to play as the astronaut. <p>These physical sets are now retired and are considered collectibles, available only through secondary marketplaces such as Brick Owl or BrickLink. <p>Closure and Legacy<p>The game was shut down due to "unsatisfactory revenue" from its subscription-based model. Despite its short run, it holds a significant place in LEGO history as the company's first major foray into the MMOG space. A dedicated fan base has worked to revive the game through emulated private servers, allowing enthusiasts to experience the game as it was before its closure.
