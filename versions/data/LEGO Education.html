LEGO Education is an arm of The LEGO Group dedicated to creating hands-on, playful learning experiences for students from preschool through middle school. These solutions integrate the familiar LEGO brick with lessons aligned to educational standards (like STEAM—Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math), digital tools, and programmable hardware to build critical 21st-century skills. <p>The LEGO Learning System <p>LEGO Education's current approach is built around an interconnected system of products that scale with a student's age and abilities, building knowledge year over year.  <p>Educational Philosophy <p>The core philosophy is "learning through play," a research-backed approach that suggests students retain information better and develop problem-solving skills when actively engaged. This is structured around the "4 C's" framework for a lesson:  <p>Connect: Introduce the task and build on existing knowledge. <p>Construct: A hands-on building activity to promote experimentation. <p>Contemplate: Reflect on and share insights from the build.
Continue: End with a new task that builds on the learned knowledge, fostering curiosity.  <p>Competitions and Community <p>LEGO Education products are a central part of the global FIRST® LEGO® League program, where teams of students design, build, and program robots to solve real-world challenges. The program includes different age divisions:  <p>FIRST LEGO League Discover (Ages 4-6) <p>FIRST LEGO League Explore (Ages 6-10) <p>FIRST LEGO League Challenge (Ages 9-16)  <p>Educators can also join the Ambassador Program to share best practices and receive professional development support. You can find more information and resources on the official LEGO Education website or through authorized re-sellers.
