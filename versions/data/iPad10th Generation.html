iPad 10th Generation
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The iPad (10th generation) (also referred to as the iPad 10.9-inch) is a tablet computer developed and marketed by Apple Inc. as the successor to the ninth-generation iPad. It was announced on October 18, 2022, and was released on October 26, 2022.<p>The design of the tenth-generation iPad more closely resembles the higher-end iPad Air and Pro models, with flatter edges and no home button. As with the iPad Air and Mini, the Touch ID sensor is located in the power button. It is available in silver, blue, pink, and yellow color finishes.<p>
Like the iPad Air, it has a 10.9-inch 2360x1640 Liquid Retina display; an increase from the previous 10.2-inch model, but it is not laminated. The tenth-generation iPad uses an A14 Bionic processor, previously seen in the fourth-generation iPad Air and the iPhone 12 in 2020. The chip has a 6-core CPU, a 4-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine.<p>The tenth-generation iPad has Bluetooth 5.2 and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) wireless capabilities, as well as sub-6 GHz 5G on cellular models. It is the first base model iPad to use USB-C instead of the Lightning connector; connectivity is limited to USB 2.0 transfer speeds, with support for external displays at 1080p resolution at a refresh rate of 60 Hz, or 2160p at 30 Hz. The tenth-generation iPad does not include a headphone connector, requiring wireless headphones or a USB-C adapter sold separately.<p>The tenth-generation iPad features a 12-megapixel rear-facing wide-angle camera with an ƒ/1.8 aperture and 4K video recording support. In a first for any iPad, the front-facing camera is now located on the long edge of the display, so that it is horizontally centered when the tablet is in a landscape orientation.
