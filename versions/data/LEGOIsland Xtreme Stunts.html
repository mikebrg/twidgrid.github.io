The LEGO Island Xtreme Stunts was a short-lived, discontinued product line from 2002 to 2003, linked to the third and final video game in the LEGO Island series. The theme featured an action-movie storyline where characters performed various stunts on LEGO Island. <p>Theme Overview and Story<p>The storyline revolved around movie moguls arriving on LEGO Island to film an action blockbuster titled "Xtreme Stunts", with the main character, Pepper Roni, cast as the lead stuntman. Ironically, the mischievous Brickster was cast as the main villain but quickly devised his own plan to disassemble the entire world using a supercomputer. Players, as Pepper Roni, had to complete various stunt-based missions around an open-world island to finish the film and stop the Brickster's plot. <p>The sets themselves included vehicles and locations seen in the game's various stunt scenes, but the theme was discontinued after just one year of release. <p>Key Sets and Products<p>The theme included several physical sets and a tie-in video game. <p>Video Game: Island Xtreme Stunts was released in late 2002 for the PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, and Game Boy Advance platforms.
