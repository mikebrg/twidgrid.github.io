"TechPlay" is not an official, current LEGO theme name, but it was a sub-theme of the LEGO Technic line that was available from 1996 to 2001. The term is also used in a broader, modern context by The LEGO Group to refer to the intersection of technology and play (e.g., in their "Tech and Play" initiative). <p>The Discontinued LEGO Technic "Tech Play" Theme (1996-2001)<p>This sub-theme was designed to offer a variety of building options and introduce basic engineering principles in a fun way. The sets focused on convertibility and multi-functional models. <p>Focus: Sets often featured a core set of pieces that could be built into multiple different vehicles, such as cars, planes, or boats, encouraging creativity and exploration of different mechanisms.<p>Play Features: The sets included functional components like steering systems, gear functions, and sometimes a base unit to which different models could be attached.<p>Notable Sets:<p>Convertables (Set number: 8244): A vintage 1996 set with 276 pieces designed to build a variety of models that plugged into a base unit.<p>Starter Tech Play (Set number: 8210, etc.): A range of smaller starter sets within the sub-theme.<p>Giant Model Set (Set number: 8277): A large set from 1997 with a wide assortment of pieces for advanced building. <p>Modern "Tech and Play" Concepts<p>Today, The LEGO Group and The LEGO Foundation use the phrase "Tech and Play" to describe their initiatives and products that combine physical building with digital technology to foster STEM skills and creative coding. <p>LEGO Education: Products like SPIKE Prime and BricQ Motion are part of a system that integrates technology and play for learning.<p>Powered Up and CONTROL+ Apps: Modern Technic and City sets use apps to add remote control and real-time feedback to physical models, blurring the lines between physical bricks and digital interaction.
