They were the "good guys" in the ongoing conflict with the Black Falcons, another popular faction of the era. The theme was known for its detailed castles, jousting tournaments, and focus on classic medieval life. <p>Aesthetic: Minifigures wore iconic red and yellow quartered tunics with a lion crest. They had a variety of weapons, flags, and shields with the same heraldry.<p>Characters: The theme included a king figure and a variety of knights and soldiers, some with feathered helmets and detailed armor.<p>Play Features: Sets included working drawbridges, catapults, and hidden treasure chests, encouraging imaginative play. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets
