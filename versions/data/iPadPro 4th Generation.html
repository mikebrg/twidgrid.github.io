The fourth-generation iPad Pro is a line of tablet computers developed and marketed by Apple Inc. Two models, with an 11-inch or 12.9 inch screen, were both announced on March 18, 2020, and released on March 25, 2020.<p>The iPad Pro features a similar design, and the same screen sizes, as the previous generation, but has an upgraded camera module with LiDAR capabilities and an updated A12Z Bionic processor with one additional GPU core. The 11 inch model is the second generation of that size, and describes itself as such.
