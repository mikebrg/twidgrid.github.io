In September 2014, GoPro released an entry-level camera named simply "HERO", priced at $130, alongside the HERO4 Black and HERO4 Silver. It is built into a waterproof housing, unlike the HERO4 line.

The GoPro HERO (2014) can capture 5 MP still images and has a 5 fps burst option. It is able to record 1080p at 30 or 25 fps and 720p at 60 or 50 fps on to a MicroSD card up to 32 GB. It has an LCD non touch display on the front and is waterproof down to 40 m (130 ft).
