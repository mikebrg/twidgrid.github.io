LEGO provides minimal official lighting components, but a thriving ecosystem of third-party light kits and accessories exists to illuminate LEGO sets and custom creations. <p>Official LEGO Lighting Solutions<p>The LEGO Group itself primarily offers functional lighting as part of its Powered Up and older Power Functions motor systems, which integrate with other electronic components. <p>Powered Up Light (Item No. 88005): This is the main official lighting accessory currently available. It features two LED lights attached to a connecting wire and a connection point, which plugs into a Powered Up Hub (like those found in compatible sets) for power and control. It's designed for simple, integrated illumination within powered models, such as trains.<p>Light Bricks: Specific LEGO sets sometimes include a single "light brick"—a specialized, often translucent, brick with a simple push-button light feature. These are self-contained and battery-powered.<p>Minifigure Accessories: Certain minifigure accessories, most notably the Star Wars lightsaber blades, can be paired with third-party lights to illuminate them, but LEGO does not make the illuminating components for them. <p>Third-Party LEGO Lighting Kits<p>The vast majority of lighting options for LEGO sets come from third-party companies that specialize in custom LED solutions. These brands offer kits tailored to specific, popular LEGO sets, from the Titanic to modular buildings. <p>Custom-Designed Kits: Brands like Light My Bricks, Game of Bricks, and BrickBling create comprehensive light kits for individual LEGO sets. These kits are designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing build with ultra-thin wires and small "bit lights" that fit between and underneath bricks.<p>DIY Components: These companies also offer a range of individual components for custom builders, including:<p>Bit Lights: Tiny LEDs on thin wires that can be placed almost anywhere.<p>Strip Lights: For illuminating larger areas like room interiors or streetlights.<p>Expansion Boards and Cables: For connecting multiple lights to a single power source (USB or battery pack).<p>Remote Controls and Dimmers: To adjust brightness or turn lights on/off easily.<p>Installation: These kits often come with detailed instructions, sometimes offering options to light the set "as you build" or "after you build" by partially deconstructing the model.
