The LEGO Knights' Kingdom II theme is a discontinued castle-themed product line that ran from 2004 to 2006. It featured a narrative-driven story in the fictional land of Morcia, where a group of knights fought the evil Lord Vladek. The theme is also unique for its blend of traditional minifigure sets and large, Bionicle-style action figures. <p>Story and Characters<p>The storyline was an updated, more action-oriented take on the general medieval setting, with an extensive plot detailed in comics, books, and online games. The story followed four main heroes who battled Vladek, the villain who imprisoned King Mathias. <p>King Jayko (formerly Sir Jayko): The central hero, initially the blue knight, who eventually becomes king.<p>Sir Danju, Sir Rascus, and Sir Santis: The other three main knights, each with their own color (purple, green, and light blue, respectively) and unique crest.<p>Lord Vladek: The main antagonist, a power-hungry former advisor to the King, who commanded an army of "Shadow Knights".<p>King Mathias: The true King of Morcia, imprisoned by Vladek. <p>Notable Sets<p>The theme included a wide range of sets, from small border skirmishes to large fortresses. <p>The Castle of Morcia (Set number: 8781): The initial main castle set, which included minifigures of the main heroes, King Mathias, Vladek, and a Shadow Knight.
Vladek's Dark Fortress (Set number: 8877): The main villain base from the second wave of sets, noted as the largest set of the theme.<p>King's Castle (Set number: 10176): A large, detailed castle set released under the theme's branding, though it was an homage to previous Castle themes rather than an official part of the story.<p>Action Figures: A major component of the theme was the release of large, buildable action figures (e.g., Lord Vladek (set 8795), Sir Adric (set 8704)) in canister packaging, similar to the Bionicle line at the time.
