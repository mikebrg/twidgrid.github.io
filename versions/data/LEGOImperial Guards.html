The LEGO Imperial Guards were a specific, popular, and discontinued sub-theme within the LEGO Pirates line that ran from 1990 to 1993, with sets also being available as late as 1996. They served as the primary law enforcement and military presence, often battling the classic LEGO Pirates and their leader, Captain Redbeard. <p>Theme Overview<p>The Imperial Guards were portrayed as the forces of a Governor or Governor Broadside, protecting their settlements and gold from the pirates. The theme featured detailed forts, ships, and outposts. <p>Aesthetic: Minifigures wore blue coats, white trousers, and black shako hats, giving them a British Napoleonic-era style.<p>Factions: The "good guy" faction against the pirates. They were later succeeded by the red-coated "Imperial Soldiers" (Governors) and the "Imperial Armada" (Conquistadors) themes. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are now highly sought-after collector's items and are only available on the secondary market from re-sellers. <p>Imperial Trading Post (6277): The flagship set and largest fort, featuring a dock, a lighthouse, several buildings, and a large number of minifigures and cannons.<p>Imperial Flagship (6280 - Note: set number conflict, also known as the Caribbean Clipper): The main ship of the Guards, this blue and white vessel was designed to patrol the seas and battle the pirates' Black Seas Barracuda.<p>Fort Eldorado (6276): An iconic fort set, later re-released in 2023 as an homage. It was known for its modular design and large rock baseplate.<p>Imperial Outpost (6262): A smaller, simpler outpost on a rock formation.<p>Harbor Sentry (6259): A small set featuring a dock and a single guard. <p>Legacy and Modern Homages<p>The Imperial Guards theme remains a fan favorite. While discontinued, the spirit of the theme continues through modern releases: <p>Pirates of Barracuda Bay (21322): A large, fan-designed set released in 2020 that served as a modern homage to the classic Pirates theme and included several minifigures with the classic Imperial Guard uniform.<p>El Dorado Fortress (10320): Released in 2023, this is a direct, detailed adult collector's remake of the original Fort Eldorado set, incorporating modern building techniques while retaining the classic Imperial Guards look and feel.
