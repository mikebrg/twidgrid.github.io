The Odyssey is a 16-camera panoramic stereo rig designed to produce content for the Google Jump virtual reality platform by synchronizing the cameras and automatically stitching their footage together. The Odyssey was originally announced at Google I/O in May 2015 and GoPro began taking applications from "professional content creators" in September for the US$15,000 rig, which included 16 GoPro HERO4 Black cameras; limited shipments began in May 2016.
