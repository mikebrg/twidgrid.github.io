" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The MacBook Air with the M2 Chip, released on July 15, 2022, featured the first major physical redesign of the Air since 2010. It adopted a modern, flatter unibody chassis, a slightly larger 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display with thinner bezels and a camera notch, enhanced performance, and new color options. <p>Key Features and Ports<p>Completely New Design: A modern, flat-edged, and remarkably thin enclosure that was significantly lighter than the M1 MacBook Pro and thinner than the tapered M1 Air model it replaced.<p>M2 Chip: Provided a performance boost over the M1, with an 18 percent faster CPU, up to a 35 percent faster GPU, and increased memory bandwidth.<p>Liquid Retina Display: A larger and brighter display than the previous generation, featuring thinner bezels and incorporating a notch to house an improved 1080p FaceTime HD camera.<p>MagSafe 3 and Ports: The return of a dedicated MagSafe 3 charging port was a significant change, freeing up the two existing Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports (USB-C connector) for other peripherals. A 3.5 mm headphone jack was also included.<p>Keyboard: Featured a full-height function row on the backlit "Magic Keyboard" with Touch ID.<p>Audio: Included a new four-speaker sound system integrated between the keyboard and display, offering improved stereo separation and clarity.<p>No Fan: Like its M1 predecessor, this model was designed without a fan for silent operation.
