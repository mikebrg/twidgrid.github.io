The LEGO The Batman Movie theme was a discontinued product line released between 2017 and 2018, based on the animated film of the same name. It included over 40 sets, polybags, collectible minifigure series, and other tie-in products that captured the humor and extensive character roster of the film. <p>Overview<p>The theme brought the unique, brick-built animation style of the movie into physical sets. It featured Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Alfred, and a vast array of DC heroes and villains, many of whom were previously unrepresented in LEGO form. The product line included standard construction sets, two series of collectible minifigures, and sets as part of the LEGO Dimensions video game. The main construction set theme was discontinued by the end of 2018. <p>Notable Sets<p>
The theme included a wide range of sets, from small vehicles to large-scale locations: <p>The Batmobile (70905): A highly customizable Batmobile that could be rebuilt into four different vehicles.<p>Batcave Break-In (70909): A detailed recreation of the Batcave with various features and minifigures like the Penguin, Batman, Bruce Wayne, and Alfred Pennyworth.<p>Arkham Asylum (70912): A large set featuring the iconic asylum building and numerous key villains from the movie.<p>The Joker Manor (70922): A massive, 3,400-piece set that transformed Wayne Manor into the Joker's lair, including many exclusive features and minifigures.<p>The Ultimate Batmobile (70917): This set was a 4-in-1 vehicle that could split into the Batmobile, Batwing, Bat-Tank, and Batcycle. <p>Availability<p>As a retired theme, these sets are no longer available for purchase from the official LEGO Shop. Collectors can acquire them through secondary markets, such as online auction sites and specialized brick retailers. The prices on the secondary market can vary significantly depending on the set's rarity, condition (new vs. used), and whether it is sealed in its original box.
