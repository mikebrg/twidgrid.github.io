The sets featured a darker, more conflict-oriented tone. <p>LEGO Dino Attack (2005)<p>This theme was known for its emphasis on combat and weaponized vehicles. It was rebranded as Dino 2010 in Europe, where the sets were slightly altered to focus on capturing the dinosaurs rather than fighting them. <p>T-1 Typhoon vs. T-Rex (Set number: 7477 in US / 7298 in Europe): The flagship set featured a large vehicle with a net launcher and a crane to capture the giant T-Rex.<p>Dino Attack HQ (Set number: 7476): The human base of operations.<p>Iron Predator vs. T-Rex (Set number: 7474): A ground vehicle battle with a T-Rex.<p>Steel Sprinter vs. Mutant Lizard (Set number: 7473): A smaller set featuring a quad bike and a lizard.<p>T-Rex Hunter (Set number: 7475): Featured a vehicle designed to hunt the T-Rex. <p>Other LEGO Dino Themes<p>LEGO has released several other themes featuring dinosaurs over the years, varying in style and focus. <p>Adventurers: Dino Island (2000): Part of the Adventurers theme, this focused on a team of explorers on an island with large, molded dinosaurs.<p>Dinosaurs (2001): A standalone theme that featured buildable dinosaur models using specialized parts, but did not include minifigures.<p>Dino (2012): A separate, non-licensed theme that focused on capturing dinosaurs with tranquilizer weapons and armored vehicles.
