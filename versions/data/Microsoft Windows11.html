Windows 11 is the current major release of Microsoft's Windows NT operating system, released on October 5, 2021, as the successor to Windows 10 (2015). It is available as a free upgrade for devices running Windows 10 that meet its system requirements. The Windows Server counterpart, Server 2025, was released in 2024. Windows 11 is the first major version of Windows without a corresponding mobile edition, following the discontinuation of Windows 10 Mobile and is implemented to mobile devices with different form factors, screen sizes and CPU architectures (including tablets and handheld game consoles with smaller screen sizes) as a unified edition of Windows. As of October 14, 2025, Windows 11 is the only fully supported consumer-oriented version of Windows.<p>Windows 11 introduced a redesigned Windows shell influenced by elements of the canceled Windows 10X project, including a centered Start menu, a separate "Widgets" panel replacing live tiles, and new window management features. It also incorporates gaming technologies from the Xbox Series X and Series S, such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage on supported hardware. The Chromium-based Microsoft Edge remains the default web browser, replacing Internet Explorer, while Microsoft Teams is integrated into the interface. Microsoft also expanded support for third-party applications in the Microsoft Store, including limited compatibility with Android apps through a partnership with the Amazon Appstore.<p>Windows 11 introduced significantly higher system requirements than typical operating system upgrades, which Microsoft attributed to security considerations. The operating system requires features such as UEFI, Secure Boot, and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0. Official support is limited to devices with an eighth-generation Intel Core or newer processor, a second-generation AMD Ryzen or newer processor, or a Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 or later system-on-chip. These restrictions exclude a substantial number of systems, prompting criticism from users and media. While installation on unsupported hardware is technically possible, Microsoft does not guarantee access to updates or support. Windows 11 became the first operating system to drop support for all 32-bit processors, running only on x86-64 and ARM64 architectures.<p>Windows 11 received mixed reviews upon its release. Prelaunch discussion focused on its increased hardware requirements, with debate over whether these changes were primarily motivated by security improvements or to encourage users to purchase newer devices. The operating system was generally praised for its updated visual design, improved window management, and enhanced security features. However, critics pointed to changes in the user interface, such as limitations on taskbar customization and difficulties in changing default applications, as steps back from Windows 10. In June 2025, Windows 11 surpassed Windows 10 as the most installed version of Windows worldwide. As of December 2025, Windows 11 is the most used version of Windows, accounting for 51% of the worldwide market share, while its predecessor Windows 10 holds 45%, and Windows 7 holds 4%. Windows 11 is the most-used traditional PC operating system, with a 38% share of users.
