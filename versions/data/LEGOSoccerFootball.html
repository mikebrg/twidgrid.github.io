The original LEGO Soccer/Football theme was a discontinued product line that ran from 1998 to 2006 as a sub-theme of the larger LEGO Sports line. While the interactive play-focused sets are retired, LEGO continues to produce modern, detailed display and playable sets related to the sport. <p>Discontinued Original Themes (1998-2006)<p>The original sets were designed to be interactive, tabletop games with minifigures on special stands that could be flicked to pass or shoot the ball. <p>Town/Football (1998): The initial sets were a brief part of the Town theme, often available as promotional items with sponsors like Shell.
