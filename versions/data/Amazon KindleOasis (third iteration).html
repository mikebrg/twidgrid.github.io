Amazon Kindle Oasis (third iteration)
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
Amazon released the third-iteration Kindle Oasis, colloquially referred to as the Oasis 3, on July 24, 2019. Externally it is nearly identical in appearance to the second-iteration Oasis, with a similar 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display, adjustable warm light, one-handed design, waterproofing, aluminium exterior, Bluetooth support and Micro USB for charging. It adds a 25 LED front light that can adjust color temperature to warmer tones, the first Kindle to be able to do so. This device is available in two different colors; Graphite or Champagne Gold.
<p>The Verge gave the Oasis 3 an 8 out of 10 rating, praising its design, display, and warmer E Ink display, but criticizing its high cost, no USB-C support and the lackluster update over the 2017 model. Amazon removed the Oasis 3 from the US market in late February 2024, after an unusually long sales period of nearly five years without a hardware change, and without a new model to succeed it. Press were told in October 2024 that Amazon had no plans to build new devices with buttons, and would not stock more Oasis units once existing inventory was depleted.
