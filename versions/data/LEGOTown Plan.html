LEGO Town Plan
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The LEGO Town Plan was a foundational "System in Play" concept launched in 1955, designed to provide a context for children to arrange their LEGO buildings and vehicles into a complete urban setting. It was centered around a printed mat (initially plastic cloth, later Masonite) showing a network of streets and building plots. <p>Overview of the Town Plan System<p>The Town Plan was developed in collaboration with the Danish Council for Road Safety, aiming to teach children about traffic behavior. <p>Road Layouts: The core component was the printed town board, which featured a stylized network of streets, parking spaces, and areas for buildings. Unlike modern baseplates, these original boards were mostly flat with printed roads, not studded.<p>Scale: The early sets were based on a smaller 1:87 (HO) scale, not the later minifigure scale.<p>Vehicles and Accessories: The system included small, non-brick-built plastic cars and lorries, as well as miniature police officers (also non-brick-built) to direct traffic.<p>Buildings: Children could use their standard LEGO bricks to build houses, shops, a gas station, or a town hall on the designated plots on the map.<p>Special Pieces: The Town Plan introduced some specialized elements, such as garage baseplates with a slope that allowed a car to roll out when the door was opened, and clear showcase bricks for car showrooms. <p>Legacy<p>The original Town Plan theme ran until 1966. The concept was a direct inspiration for the later, more extensive LEGOLAND Town theme introduced in 1978, which used studded baseplates with roads to integrate buildings more seamlessly into the system. <p>In 2008, LEGO released a special, modern tribute set for the 50th anniversary of the LEGO brick: the LEGO 10184 Town Plan. This set recreated the aesthetic of the 1950s town but used modern bricks and was built to the scale of the contemporary minifigure.
