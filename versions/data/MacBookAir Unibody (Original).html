MacBook Air Unibody (Original)
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The original aluminum unibody MacBook Air, introduced by Steve Jobs on January 15, 2008, was promoted as the "world's thinnest notebook" and emphasized portability over performance. It featured an ultra-thin wedge-shaped design, a 13.3-inch LED-backlit display, and a full-size backlit keyboard. <p>Key Features and Ports<p>Design: The enclosure was machined from a single block of aluminum, creating a durable unibody design. It measured an unprecedented 0.16 inches at its thinnest point and 0.76 inches at its thickest.<p>Connectivity Compromises: To achieve its thinness, the MacBook Air made significant compromises in connectivity. It only included one USB 2.0 port, a micro-DVI port (adapters for DVI and VGA were included), and a headphone jack.<p>Missing Ports: It notably lacked a FireWire port, an Ethernet port (an external USB adapter was sold separately), and a built-in optical drive.<p>Remote Disc: Apple introduced "Remote Disc" software, allowing users to wirelessly access the optical drive of another computer to install software.<p>Other Features: It included built-in 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, a built-in iSight camera, and a large multi-touch trackpad that supported gestures like pinching, swiping, and rotating.<p>Power: It used a 45 Watt MagSafe Power Adapter. The battery was not designed to be user-replaceable.
