The LEGO Time Twisters was the antagonist sub-theme of the discontinued LEGO Time Cruisers product line, available in 1997 (while the broader theme ran from 1996-1998). The sets are no longer in production and are only available from re-sellers. <p>Theme Overview<p>The storyline, detailed in comics and instruction booklets, centered on the evil Time Twisters, a group of villains who built time machines powered by cylinders filled with valuable artifacts from the past. They traveled through different LEGO historical themes to steal these items and interfere with history, while the "good" Time Cruisers, led by Dr. Cyber, tried to stop them and repair the damage. <p>The sets were known for their unusual, "mixed-up" appearance, combining elements from various themes like Pirates, Castle (Fright Knights), Western, and Town, reflecting their time-traveling nature. <p>Key Characters<p>The Time Twisters were led by a pair of twins and accompanied by other spooky characters: <p>Tony Twister & Professor Millennium: The main twin antagonists.<p>Goldie: A ghost figure who accompanied the villains.<p>Boney: A skeleton figure with a wizard's hat who served the Twisters. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>There were only a few sets in the Time Twisters sub-theme, making them valuable collector's items. <p>Twisted Time Train (Set number: 6497): The largest set, it was a bizarre, multi-car train combining features from steam locomotives with castle and spooky elements.<p>Whirling Time Warper (Set number: 6496): A vehicle that had a spinning function and included Professor Millennium and Goldie minifigures.<p>Time Tunnelator (Set number: 6495, and an alternate version 6499): A smaller, basic vehicle for the Time Twister character.<p>Time Cruisers Board Game (Set number: GA04): A board game that used the Time Twister minifigure as a player-controlled antagonist who tried to steal artifacts from the other players. <p>These sets are no longer produced by The LEGO Group.
