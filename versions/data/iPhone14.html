The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular networks. The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022, and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was launched with iOS 16. Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022. Along with the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are the last iPhones to feature the Lightning port, as their successors, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus (announced on September 12, 2023), use a USB-C port, per European Commission regulation.<p>The iPhone 14 does not have a "Mini" version like its predecessor, the iPhone 13. Instead, Apple returned to a larger model with the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple had not introduced a "Plus" model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017. Both iPhone 14 models (as well as iPhone 14 Pro models) sold in the United States, ended support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 not to come with a discrete SIM card reader, requiring activation by way of eSIM.<p>To comply with mandates, the iPhone 14 models, along with the iPhone SE (third generation), were discontinued in the European Union in 2024, completing the iPhone's transition from a Lightning connection to USB-C. The iPhone 14 models alongside the iPhone SE (third generation) were later discontinued worldwide on February 19, 2025, following the unveil of the iPhone 16e.
