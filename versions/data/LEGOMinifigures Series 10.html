LEGO Minifigures Series 10 (item number 71001) was released in May 2013 and is notable for its inclusion of the ultra-rare Mr. Gold minifigure, a limited-edition character of which only 5,000 were distributed worldwide. The original retail price per blind bag was $2.99. <p>Characters Included<p>The series consists of 16 standard minifigures, plus the rare Mr. Gold, each originally packaged in a sealed "mystery" bag with accessories, a display plate, and a collector's leaflet. <p>Librarian: Comes with a book and a "Shhh!" mug accessory.<p>Medusa: A mythical figure with a unique snake hairpiece.<p>Roman Commander: Features a silver sword and a red cape.<p>Warrior Woman: Includes a shield and spear accessory.<p>Tomahawk Warrior: Comes with a tomahawk weapon.<p>Skydiver: Features a helmet and a detailed lime green parachute backpack.<p>Bumblebee Girl: A popular mascot figure with a full bee costume and a jar of honey.<p>Grandpa: Includes a mug and a newspaper accessory.<p>Paintball Player: Comes with a black paintball marker.<p>Sea Captain: Features a white captain's hat and a seagull with binoculars.<p>Sad Clown: A clown figure with a tear on his face.<p>Revolutionary Soldier: Comes with a musket weapon.<p>Baseball Fielder: Includes a baseball glove.<p>Trendsetter: Features a small dog and a smartphone accessory.<p>Decorator: Comes with a paint roller and a bucket with paint splotches.<p>Motorcycle Mechanic: Includes a black wrench tool.<p>Mr. Gold: A very rare, special golden minifigure included randomly in select bags, which sparked significant collector interest. <p>Collectibility<p>Series 10 is a retired product line, and sets are no longer available in standard retail stores. Due to the limited production of Mr. Gold and the overall popularity of the series, figures like the Bumblebee Girl, Medusa, Roman Commander, and the extremely valuable Mr. Gold are highly sought after by collectors on secondary markets.
