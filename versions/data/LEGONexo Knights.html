LEGO Nexo Knights

LEGO Nexo Knights was a fantasy-based Castle theme launched in January 2016 that blended medieval knight elements with a futuristic, digital twist. The product line ran until the end of 2018 and was supported by an animated TV series and an interactive mobile app. 
Concept and Story<p>The theme is set in the fictional kingdom of Knighton, a world of advanced technology and medieval architecture. The story follows five young knights—Clay Moorington, Princess Macy Halbert, Lance Richmond, Aaron Fox, and Axl—who have recently graduated from the Knights' Academy. <p>They operate from their rolling castle, the Fortrex, and use advanced vehicles and holographic powers to defend the realm from the evil Jestro, the sentient Book of Monsters (which is the arch-necromancer Monstrox in disguise), and their army of Lava Monsters. The knights are assisted by the digital wizard Merlok 2.0. <p>Digital Integration<p>A key feature of the Nexo Knights theme was its integration with digital play. The accompanying free mobile app, LEGO NEXO KNIGHTS: MERLOK 2.0, allowed children to scan physical "Nexo Power" shields found in the LEGO sets, in the TV show, and in print materials. Scanning these shields unlocked virtual powers, adding new abilities to the in-game experience and linking the physical and digital worlds. <p>Product Line<p>The sets themselves featured a distinct color scheme of silver and blue for the heroes and brown/trans-orange for the villains' lava-themed vehicles and structures. The product line featured various items: <p>Vehicles and Mechs: Sets included futuristic interpretations of knightly gear, such as the large, rolling base The Fortrex (70317), Clay's Rumble Blade (70315), and Aaron's Rock Climber (70355).<p>Villain Bases: Notable villain sets included Jestro's Evil Mobile (70316) and Jestro's Volcano Lair (70323).<p>Action Figures: A series of smaller, buildable "Action" figures for the main characters (e.g., Action Macy (70363)) were also part of the line.<p>Books and Accessories: Various books, polybags, and a collectible minifigure series were also released to support the theme. <p>Although popular among some fans for its creative blend of fantasy and technology, the theme was discontinued in 2018.
