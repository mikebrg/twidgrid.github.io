A refreshed MAX was unveiled on February 18, 2025. It includes software improvements such as introducing object tracking and additional camera effects via the Quik app. It uses a standard 1/4-20 thread mount, making it compatible with most tripods and sticks, however, most other hardware specifications remain the same as the previous MAX.
