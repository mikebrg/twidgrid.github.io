The LEGO World Racers theme was a short-lived, discontinued product line released in 2010 that centered around two rival racing teams competing in a high-stakes, around-the-world competition for a World Cup trophy. The theme ran for a single year and was an original intellectual property from the LEGO Group, not tied to any external film or TV franchise. <p>Theme Overview<p>The storyline pitted two teams against each other in various hazardous locations: <p>The X-Treme Daredevils (the "good guys," using blue/green vehicles)<p>The Backyard Blasters (the "bad guys," using red/orange vehicles) <p>The races were held in extreme environments, such as deserts, swamps, icy mountains, and coral reefs, and the vehicles were equipped with "weaponry" like dynamite and net launchers to battle their opponents. A key difference from previous LEGO Racers themes was the inclusion of minifigures, which brought character-driven role-play to the sets. <p>Construction Sets<p>A total of nine sets (six main sets and three promotional polybags) were released in 2010. <p>Snake Canyon (8896): A small set featuring two vehicles and a canyon setting with a snake.<p>Jagged Jaws Reef (8897): Included two race boats battling a shark and a trophy buoy.<p>Wreckage Road (8898): A larger set with two cars, a start/finish gateway, and four minifigures.<p>Gator Swamp (8899): Featured two hovercrafts and a gator, set in a swamp environment.<p>Blizzard's Peak (8863): A snow-themed set at an icy mountain location, involving an official judging the race.<p>Desert of Destruction (8864): The largest set in the theme, featuring a desert mobile base with several vehicles, a crane, and an award podium. <p>Collectibility<p>As the LEGO World Racers theme was discontinued in the same year it was released, the sets are no longer available in standard retail stores. They are now retired collector's items and can be found on secondary marketplaces, where prices are driven by demand and condition.
