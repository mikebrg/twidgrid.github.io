LEGO Hockey was a discontinued sub-theme of the LEGO Sports theme that was available from 2003 to 2004. It featured an official partnership with the National Hockey League (NHL) and the NHL Players' Association. <p>Theme Details<p>The theme included a mix of figure types, primarily larger, buildable action figures made with Technic and Bionicle pieces, designed to "slap shot" pucks when a button was pressed. Later sets in 2004 introduced traditional minifigures mounted on plates with poles, allowing for a tabletop foosball-style game. <p>Licensing: Sets featured the official NHL logo and included stickers for all 29 NHL teams at the time, allowing builders to customize their players and rinks to match their favorite team.<p>Gameplay: The focus was on playable sets that simulated a hockey game, rather than static display models. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>NHL Championship Challenge (Set number: 3578): This large set was designed for a tabletop game and included eight minifigures, an arena setup, and poles to move the players and control the game.
Slammer Stadium (Set number: 65182): Another arena-style set that featured the larger, buildable "slammer" figures for play.<p>NHL Street Hockey (Set number: 3579): This set was an exception to the larger figures, as it featured actual LEGO minifigures to play street hockey.
Individual Player Packs: Smaller sets like Puck Passer (set 3540), Slap Shot (set 3541), and Slammer Goalie (set 3543) included individual action figures and goals to expand the game. <p>Modern Options<p>While the official LEGO Hockey theme is discontinued, the concept has appeared elsewhere: <p>A Hockey Player minifigure was available as a collectible minifigure in Series 4 (set 8804) released in 2011.<p>Fans still create custom builds, and some third-party compatible brick manufacturers offer hockey-themed sets.
