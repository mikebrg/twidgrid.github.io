The iPhone Air is a smartphone developed by Apple. It is part of the nineteenth generation of the iPhone. The device was announced alongside the lower-priced iPhone 17 and the higher-priced iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 9, 2025. The iPhone Air replaces the Plus series in the iPhone lineup, with a rebranded option focused on lightweight design and enhanced features. With a depth of 5.6 mm (0.22 in), it is the iPhone with the thinnest body ever produced, surpassing the 6.9 mm (0.27 in) thick iPhone 6. This excludes the top of the phone with a depth of 11.3 mm (0.44 in).
