MacBook (Polycarbonate)
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The original polycarbonate MacBook, released on May 16, 2006, served as the consumer-level replacement for the iBook series and was available in white or black cases. It featured an Intel Core Duo processor, a 13.3-inch glossy widescreen display, and innovations like the MagSafe power connector. <p>Key Features and Ports<p>Design: A polycarbonate and fiberglass casing that was thinner than the iBook G4 it replaced. It was available in white or a more expensive black color option.<p>MagSafe Power Adapter: This model was the second Apple laptop to adopt the new magnetic power connector.<p>Built-in iSight Camera: An integrated webcam with 640x480 resolution for video calls.<p>Ports: Includes two USB 2.0 ports, one FireWire 400 port, a Gigabit Ethernet port, and a mini-DVI video output port (adapters for DVI and VGA sold separately). It notably lacked the FireWire 800 port found on the MacBook Pro.<p>Software Support: The final supported operating system for this Core Duo model is Mac OS X 10.6.8 "Snow Leopard". Due to the 32-bit processor architecture, it is unable to run OS X 10.7 Lion or later versions.
