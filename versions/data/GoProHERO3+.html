GoPro HERO3+
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions, replacing the HERO3 generation.<p>
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low-light performance and have a waterproof enclosure, which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7 in vs. about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus, which is slightly less sharp with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).<p>
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48, 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4k15 and 2.7k30 and can shoot 12 MP stills at up to 30 fps. The HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") that increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low-light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.), etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wi-Fi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation. The battery runtime of the HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than that of the HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.<p>
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10 MP stills at up to 10 fps. In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%–50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries). The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination and whether Wi-Fi and the GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of the HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of the HERO2 and HERO1.<p>The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.
