"LEGO Agents 2.0" was not a separate theme but a re-branding of the final wave of the original LEGO Agents theme, released in May 2009. The overall Agents theme ran from 2008 to 2009. <p>Theme Overview<p>The LEGO Agents line was inspired by classic spy thrillers and comedies like James Bond and Mission Impossible, focusing on an elite team of agents using high-tech gear to thwart the global crime syndicate led by the villainous Dr. Inferno. The "2.0" re-branding introduced two new agents, gave the existing agents new body armor, and continued the storyline of battling Dr. Inferno and his expanded cast of cyborg villains. <p>Sets in the "Agents 2.0" Wave<p>The final wave consisted of five sets released in mid-2009, which focused on the agents stopping various heists and a giant robot attack on the city. <p>Gold Tooth's Getaway (8967): A small set featuring Gold Tooth escaping with his golden gun and Agent Swipe in pursuit.<p>River Heist (8968): Features a jet ski for Agent Fuse and a speed boat for the villains, who are stealing gold and dynamite.<p>4-Wheeling Pursuit (8969): Agent Chase pursues Dr. D. Zaster in a rugged 4-wheeler vehicle.<p>Robo Attack (8970): A medium-sized set featuring Dr. Inferno in a large, buildable robotic suit attacking the city.<p>Aerial Defense Unit (8971): The largest set of the wave, featuring a large agents' supersonic jet fighting off the Magma Commander and Magma Drones. <p>Collectibility<p>The entire LEGO Agents theme, including the Agents 2.0 sets, was discontinued by the end of 2009 and is now retired. These sets are considered collectible items and are available exclusively through secondary marketplaces like eBay and BrickLink, as they are no longer sold in standard retail stores. The theme was later succeeded by the distinct, app-integrated LEGO Ultra Agents theme in 2014.
