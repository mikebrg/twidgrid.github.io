LEGO refers to the part commonly called a "gearstick" by fans with official names such as "Gear Shifter" or "Gear Shift Lever". These pieces are used in both standard System sets for aesthetic detail and in Technic sets to control complex gearboxes. <p>Common "Gearstick" Parts<p>There are two primary types of parts commonly used for gearsticks in LEGO models:<p>Miniature Stick (Part 4592 / 73587): This is a small, basic 1x1 brick with a stick that is widely used in car and vehicle models for interior detail. It's often referred to as a "Plate, Modified 1 x 1 with Upright Holder" or simply a "gearstick" on marketplaces.<p>Technic Gear Shifter (Part 35188 or 6641 / 19437): In the LEGO Technic theme, this is a more complex element designed to interact with "driving rings" to build functional gearboxes. Moving the lever physically shifts gears within the model. <p>Availability<p>Both general "gearstick" pieces and the more complex Technic "Gear Shifter" elements are current and widely available. <p>Official LEGO Sources: You can find these parts in many current sets (especially Technic and Speed Champions) or purchase individual pieces through the official LEGO "Pick a Brick" service.<p>Third-Party Marketplaces: Websites like BrickLink and BrickOwl offer a vast selection of these elements in various colors from independent sellers.
