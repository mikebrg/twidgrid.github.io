The "LEGO Peace Pistol" (Danish: Fredspistol) was one of the very first toy products made by The LEGO Group, initially produced in wood in 1945 to celebrate the end of World War II, and later updated in plastic in 1949. It is a rare collector's item and the only realistic toy gun ever officially produced by the company. <p>History of the Peace Pistol<p>The Peace Pistol was a significant product in LEGO's early history, marking a deviation from the company's later, well-known policy against creating realistic modern weaponry. <p>1945 (Wood Version): The toy was first made of wood after the liberation of Denmark, intended as a toy to celebrate peace following the war. It was Godtfred Kirk Christiansen's (the son of the LEGO founder) first patented toy design, featuring an innovative semi-automatic firing mechanism.<p>1949 (Plastic Version): The design was updated and manufactured in plastic (item number 325) as the company began its shift from wood to plastic toys. This version had more molded detail and came in various colors.<p>Ammunition: Both versions used special cylindrical wood or plastic "ammunition" (item number 326) that could be loaded and fired through the rapid-firing mechanism. <p>Collectibility<p>The Peace Pistol is a highly sought-after vintage item for collectors of early LEGO and toy history. It is no longer in production and is only available on third-party collector marketplaces. The LEGO Group's official policy now focuses on avoiding realistic military equipment or weapons in their modern sets, with weapon-like elements restricted to fantasy/imaginary settings like Star Wars or Ninjago.
