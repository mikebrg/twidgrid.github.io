The original LEGO Pirates theme is a discontinued but iconic product line first launched in 1989 that featured pirates, colonial soldiers, and islanders. While there is no continuous "Pirates" theme currently available, The LEGO Group has released several large-scale, detailed sets in recent years as homages and licensed tie-ins for adult collectors. <p>History of the Theme<p>The Pirates theme introduced many groundbreaking elements, including the first minifigures with varied facial expressions, the first LEGO firearms, and specialized parts for building large ships. The core conflict was between the pirates, led by Captain Redbeard, and the various Imperial forces, who changed factions over the years. <p>Original Run (1989-1997): The "golden age" featuring the iconic blue-coated Imperial Soldiers, followed by the red-coated Imperial Guards and Spanish-style Imperial Armada. This era also included the neutral Islanders sub-theme.<p>Revivals and Remakes (2001-2015): The theme saw sporadic revivals with a few new sets in 2009 and 2015, as well as remakes of classic sets in the "Legends" series.<p>Licensed Themes: The original theme was replaced by the LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean licensed theme in 2011, which featured characters and ships from the film series. <p>Current "Pirates" and Related Sets (as of December 2025)<p>While the classic, ongoing "Pirates" line is retired, several highly detailed sets inspired by or directly related to the theme are currently available or have been recently released. <p>El Dorado Fortress (10320)<p>Description: This is a direct, detailed adult collector's remake of the original 1989 Fort Eldorado set, using modern building techniques while retaining the classic Imperial Guards look and feel. It has a modular design and includes eight minifigures, a brick-built cannon, and various accessories.<p>Status: This set is currently available from the official LEGO shop.<p>Captain Jack Sparrow's Pirate Ship (10365)<p>Description: An updated, larger, and more detailed version of the Black Pearl from the Pirates of the Caribbean films, complete with eight minifigures, including Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann.<p>Status: This set is part of the licensed LEGO Icons theme and is scheduled for general release on September 15, 2025.<p>Pirates of Barracuda Bay (21322)<p>Description: This fan-designed set, released in 2020, functions as a large, detailed shipwreck island that can be reconfigured into a modern homage to the classic Black Seas Barracuda ship. It is highly sought after by fans of the original theme.<p>Status: This set is retired and no longer available on the official LEGO shop, but can be found through re-sellers.
