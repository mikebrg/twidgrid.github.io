LEGO Life of George
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
LEGO Life of George was a discontinued, innovative product line from 2011 to 2013 that was the first to combine physical LEGO bricks with a digital mobile app and augmented reality technology. The concept aimed to create "fluid play" experiences, bridging the gap between real-world building and digital interaction. <p>Overview<p>The theme revolved around a puzzle game where users were challenged to build two-dimensional models as quickly as possible using the physical bricks included in the set. A companion app (available for iOS and Android) used patented brick recognition software to scan the finished model on a special play mat and score the player based on speed and accuracy. <p>Gameplay Modes: The app featured a single-player mode with various levels set in different virtual locations, a multiplayer mode for challenging friends, and a "Creation Mode" where users could design their own models and save them in a photo album within the app.<p>Target Audience: The sets were marketed at children aged 8 and above.<p>Status: The theme was short-lived and discontinued by the end of 2013, and the required apps were deactivated on February 1, 2015, making the digital component of the game non-functional today. <p>Construction Sets<p>Only two sets were released as part of the Life of George theme: <p>Life of George 1 (21200): Launched in October 2011, this set contained 144 basic LEGO bricks in various colors, a play mat, a "Getting Started" guide, and a George sticker.<p>Life of George 2 (21201): An upgraded version released in 2012, this set was similar in concept but with different building challenges and levels. <p>Legacy<p>While the product line was short-lived, it paved the way for future LEGO themes that also attempted to blend physical and digital play, such as LEGO Fusion, LEGO Dimensions, and LEGO Hidden Side, all using variations of the technology first tested with Life of George.
