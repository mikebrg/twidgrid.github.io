The iPad (8th generation) (also referred to as the iPad 10.2-inch 2020) is a tablet computer developed and marketed by Apple Inc. as the successor to the 7th-generation iPad. It was announced on September 15, 2020 and released on September 18, 2020.<p>This iPad retains the 10.2 inch Retina display from its predecessor, the seventh-generation iPad, along with Apple Pencil (1st generation) compatibility and Smart Keyboard compatibility, though it now includes a faster A12 Bionic processor, with a Neural Engine, making it the first entry-level iPad to have a Neural Engine.
