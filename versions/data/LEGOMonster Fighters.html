The LEGO Monster Fighters theme was a short-lived product line released in mid-2012 that pitted a group of human heroes against classic movie monsters. The theme provided a "spooky" take on the traditional LEGO Adventurers style and was designed to appeal to those who enjoyed themes like Scooby-Doo or the more "monstrous" elements of LEGO Minifigures Series. <p>Overview<p>The premise of the theme focused on Lord Vampyre's plan to collect six "moonstones" to activate a powerful orb and plunge the world into eternal darkness. The Monster Fighters team, led by Dr. Rodney Rathbone, battled the iconic creatures—Frankenstein's monster, a werewolf, zombies, and the swamp creature—to stop this from happening. <p>Characters and Factions<p>The Monster Fighters Team: A group of human heroes included Dr. Rodney Rathbone, Major Quinton Steele, Ann Lee, and the zombified butler, Zombie Driver.<p>The Monsters: The villainous faction was led by Lord Vampyre, along with a cast of classic movie monsters, including:<p>The Monster and the Crazy Scientist
