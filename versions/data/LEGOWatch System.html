LEGO Watch System
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The LEGO Watch System was a unique and discontinued line of watches, first launched in 1996, that allowed users to build and customize their own timepieces using interchangeable links, straps, and bezels. <p>Features and Design<p>The core principle behind the LEGO Watch System was customization, mirroring the creativity of traditional LEGO building. <p>Interchangeable Components: Each set came with an assortment of multi-colored plastic links with LEGO studs, allowing the wearer to build the watchband in any pattern or size. Bezels and sometimes entire watch faces could also be swapped out between different sets.<p>Variety of Styles: The system included both analog and digital models, with various dial designs, including some with classic LEGO imagery, character faces, or minimalist designs.<p>Build Quality: The watches were produced in partnership with companies like Crival and ClicTime. They featured Japanese quartz movements and scratch-resistant mineral crystal lenses. They were generally water-resistant (50m to 100m, depending on the model).<p>Minifigure Integration: Many sets, particularly those aimed at children, included a non-posable minifigure replica built into one of the watchband links. <p>History<p>The watch system went through several iterations: <p>1996-2000s: The initial launch included watches for both children and adults, sometimes licensed with themes like Star Wars or Ninjago.<p>2013 Relaunch: A relaunch occurred in 2013 aimed specifically at adults, with more sophisticated designs that still incorporated the signature customizable link system. These models used a mix of plastic, aluminum, and steel in their construction.<p>Discontinuation: The production of LEGO watches with the interchangeable link system was eventually retired around 2015. <p>Availability
The LEGO Watch System is no longer in production, so new copies are considered "new old stock". They can be found on secondary markets such as eBay or from specialized re-sellers, often still in their original packaging.
