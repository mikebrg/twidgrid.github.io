The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, announced on October 27, 2016, introduced a groundbreaking interface feature: a Retina-quality multi-touch OLED strip that replaced the traditional function keys. This generation also featured a thinner, all-aluminum unibody design, an integrated Touch ID sensor, a second-generation butterfly keyboard, and an all-in-one shift to Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports. <p>Key Features and Connectivity<p>Touch Bar: A multi-touch enabled OLED strip that dynamically presented tools and controls based on the active application, replacing traditional function keys.<p>Touch ID: A fingerprint sensor integrated into the power button, secured by the new Apple T1 chip, for secure login and Apple Pay purchases.<p>Design: Thinner and lighter aluminum unibody enclosure available in Silver and Space Gray finishes.<p>Keyboard and Trackpad: Featured a second-generation butterfly mechanism keyboard with minimal key travel and a significantly larger Force Touch trackpad.<p>Ports: Marked a major shift to four universal Thunderbolt 3 ports (USB-C connector) on the 13-inch and 15-inch models (a non-Touch Bar 13-inch model with two ports was also available). These ports supported charging, Thunderbolt (up to 40 Gbps), and USB 3.1 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gbps), eliminating legacy ports like USB-A, HDMI, and the SD card slot.<p>Audio: Included a 3.5 mm headphone jack, but removed optical audio support. The speakers were redesigned for higher dynamic range and improved bass.
