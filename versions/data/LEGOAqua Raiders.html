The LEGO Aqua Raiders theme is a discontinued product line from 2007 that focused on a team of divers searching for lost treasure in the Bermuda Triangle. The sets are no longer available for purchase new from official retailers but can be found through re-sellers. <p>Theme Overview<p>The Aqua Raiders theme was a standalone continuation of the 1990s Aquazone theme, specifically the 1997 Aquaraiders sub-theme. The 2007 sets featured a team of divers using high-tech submarines and vehicles (primarily with a yellow and black color scheme) to explore the ocean floor. Their primary obstacles were monstrous sea creatures, such as giant lobsters, crabs, and squid. The minifigures wore blue and black wetsuits and helmets adorned with a blue trident logo. <p>Sets in the Collection<p>The theme consisted of seven main sets released in 2007: <p>Deep Sea Treasure Hunter (Set number: 7770): The smallest set, featuring a diver, a sea scooter, and sea snakes.<p>Angler Ambush (Set number: 7771): Included an anglerfish, two divers, and a small sea scooter.<p>Lobster Strike (Set number: 7772): Featured a giant lobster, two divers, and an underwater rover.<p>Tiger Shark Attack (Set number: 7773): Included a tiger shark and a diver's submarine with a harpoon gun.<p>Crab Crusher (Set number: 7774): Featured a giant crab, a large submarine, and a robotic exploration device.<p>Aquabase Invasion (Set number: 7775): The largest set, it depicted the Aqua Raiders' underwater base being attacked by a giant squid.<p>The Shipwreck (Set number: 7776): Featured a detailed shipwreck structure with hidden treasure, a submarine, and two sea snakes. <p>Related Themes<p>For those interested in similar themes, LEGO has produced several other underwater exploration lines over the years:<p>Aquazone (1995-1999): The original futuristic underwater theme with several sub-themes like Aquanauts and Aquasharks.<p>Divers (1997-1998): A Town sub-theme with a more realistic, present-day focus on underwater exploration.<p>Alpha Team: Mission Deep Sea (2002): An action-oriented theme that involved underwater missions.<p>Atlantis (2010-2011): A theme where divers searched for the lost city of Atlantis and battled sea creatures to find five lost treasures.
