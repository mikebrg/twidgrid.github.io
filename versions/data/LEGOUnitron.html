The LEGO Unitron theme was a short-lived, discontinued sub-theme of the LEGO Space line that was available exclusively from 1994 to 1995. It featured a united faction of astronauts using modular technology in their exploration of space and included several unique and rare elements. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The storyline depicted the Unitron faction as a cohesive group of space explorers and soldiers, identifiable by their uniform purple, black, and transparent green color scheme. Their mission involved exploration and discovery using their advanced, modular technology, which was the core play feature of the theme. <p>Key features of the sets included:<p>Modularity: Many vehicles were designed to break apart and reconfigure, or link together to form larger, more powerful vehicles. This encouraged creative building and a consistent aesthetic across the entire product line.<p>Monorail System: The flagship set, the Monorail Transport Base, utilized the rare and sought-after LEGO Monorail track system, a feature that appeared in very few themes due to its high production cost.<p>Chrome Pieces: The sets included several unique chrome silver parts, such as the helmets and control panels, adding to their premium and futuristic appearance. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>Only a handful of sets were produced under the Unitron theme, making them highly rare and valuable collector's items today. They are no longer available new from retailers and can only be found on the secondary market. <p>Monorail Transport Base (Set number: 6991): The flagship and most iconic set, it featured an electric train system, a base, and a large transport vehicle. It is one of the most valuable discontinued LEGO sets.<p>Unitron Star Hawk II (Set number: 6928): The main spacecraft of the theme, featuring the modular design principle.<p>Unitron Scout (Set number: 1787): A smaller, more affordable scout vehicle. <p>Legacy and Related Themes<p>Spyrius (1994-1996): The rival "bad guy" alien faction of the same era, featuring a red and black color scheme and more militaristic designs.<p>Exploriens (1996-1997): The next "good guy" space theme that continued the focus on exploration.<p>LEGO City Space (Current): While not a direct continuation, the modern LEGO City Space themes continue the spirit of exploration and discovery with sets inspired by real-world space agencies.
