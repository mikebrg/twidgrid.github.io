The LEGO Toy Story theme is a licensed product line based on the Disney and Pixar film franchise, with availability across several different periods: 2009–2011, 2019–2021, and a recent revival in 2025. <p>Overview<p>The theme translates the iconic characters and scenes from the Toy Story films into brick form. The sets have evolved over time: the original 2010 sets featured highly specialized, pre-molded figures that were largely single pieces, while the 2019 sets and the current 2025 sets use more standard minifigure heads and traditional arms/legs, along with starter bricks and simpler designs for a 4+ age range. <p>Construction Sets<p>The sets have spanned several films in the franchise, including the original Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, and Toy Story 4. <p>Original 2009-2010 Sets: These sets covered the first three films and featured locations like Andy's room and vehicles like the Pizza Planet Truck.<p>Woody's Roundup! (7594): A popular set recreating the Woody's Roundup TV show set from Toy Story 2, including figures of Woody, Jessie, Bullseye, and Stinky Pete.<p>Western Train Chase (7597): A detailed train model from Toy Story 3 that included figures for Woody, Buzz, Jessie, and others.<p>2019 Sets: Released to coincide with Toy Story 4, these sets were simpler (part of the LEGO Juniors/4+ line) and included new characters like Forky and Duke Caboom.<p>Buzz & Woody's Carnival Mania! (10770): A colorful carnival set with a shooting game, bumper cars, and Woody, Buzz, Ducky, and Bunny figures.<p>2025 Sets: The theme has returned for the franchise's 30th anniversary under the LEGO Disney banner.<p>Toy Story Celebration Train & RC Car (43264): A western-inspired train set for the 4+ age range that includes Woody, Jessie, Bo Peep, and Buzz Lightyear minifigures. <p>Other Products<p>LEGO Duplo: The characters have also appeared in the larger Duplo line for toddlers across several different release waves.<p>LEGO BrickHeadz: Stylized brick-built figures of Buzz Lightyear and Woody & Bo Peep were released in 2022. <p>Collectibility<p>Many of the original 2009-2011 sets are retired and considered collector's items. The highly specialized, unique character figures from that era are particularly sought after on secondary marketplaces.
