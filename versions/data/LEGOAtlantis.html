The LEGO Atlantis theme was a discontinued product line released in January 2010 and ran until the end of 2011, focusing on a team of deep-sea explorers searching for the legendary lost city. <p>Overview and Storyline<p>The narrative of the Atlantis theme revolved around a team of heroic divers equipped with futuristic underwater vehicles on a quest to find the lost city and its hidden treasures. During their mission, they encountered giant sea creatures and the "Shark Warriors," "Squid Warriors," and "Manta Ray Warriors" who guarded the city. The ultimate goal was to collect six unique "Atlantis Keys" to unlock the portal to the city of Atlantis. <p>Construction Sets<p>A total of 24 main sets and promotional polybags were released across the theme's two-year run. The sets were known for their bold red and transparent green color schemes on the human vehicles and the unique, detailed molds for the sea creature guardians. <p>Portal of Atlantis (8078): The largest set in the 2010 wave, with 1,007 pieces, featuring a large portal structure and seven minifigures.<p>Atlantis Exploration HQ (8077): A detailed underwater base of operations for the human divers.<p>City of Atlantis (7985): A significant set released in 2011 that was a detailed model of the city itself.<p>Typhoon Turbo Sub (8060): A popular mid-sized submarine vehicle for the explorer team.<p>Shadow Snapper (8079): A set featuring a large, buildable "Hammerhead Warrior" sea creature guardian.<p>Monster Crab Clash (8056): A smaller set with a giant crab guardian. <p>Collectibility<p>The LEGO Atlantis theme is now retired and sets are no longer available in standard retail stores.

The larger sets like Portal of Atlantis and City of Atlantis are particularly sought after by collectors.
