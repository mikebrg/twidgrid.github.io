The LEGO Ninjago Movie was a specific product line of LEGO construction sets available from August 2017 to December 2019, based on the 2017 film of the same name. The theme included 28 sets, a series of collectible minifigures, and several large, detailed display models like NINJAGO City. <p>Key Sets and Unique Features<p>The theme was known for its detailed set designs that aimed to capture the aesthetic of the film, which was distinct from the main Ninjago TV series product line. <p>NINJAGO City (70620): This large, highly detailed modular set was a key release, featuring 4,867 pieces and multiple levels (old world, the street, and high rise) with various themed rooms and sixteen minifigures.<p>Destiny's Bounty (70618): A large-scale model of the ninja's iconic airship, this set included 2,295 pieces and featured seven minifigures.<p>Green Ninja Mech Dragon (70612): A prominent mech build for the main character Lloyd, designed with intricate details and 544 pieces.<p>Fire Mech (70615) and Quake Mech (70632): Other large, character-specific mechs for Kai and Cole, which were heavily featured in the film and toy line.<p>Collectible Minifigures Series: A dedicated series (71019) of 20 unique "mystery bag" minifigures was released, featuring various versions of the main characters and background characters like the Sushi Chef or N-POP Girl. <p>Thematic Differences<p>The movie sets diverged from the long-running Ninjago TV series' aesthetic. The minifigures, for instance, used new hair pieces and two-piece masks to allow for more facial expression in the film's animation style. The sets also focused on large, specialized vehicles and mechs, a theme highlighted in the movie's narrative as a form of "inauthenticity" that the characters had to move beyond to find their inner strength.
