In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras. These cameras came in three editions: black, silver, and white, denoting the relative capabilities of each camera in descending order. Externally, the model is distinguished by the ink used to print the number "3" on the front of the camera.<p>All three versions of the HERO3 come in a 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with Wi-Fi built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HD HERO and HD HERO2 were physically identical) means that some accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3, which mostly also were compatible with HERO3+, see below. Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.<p>The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2. For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while the HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, the HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and the HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).<p>The Black Edition has a new 12 MP sensor, the Sony IMX117, that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The IMX117 is the first BSI sensor included in a GoPro. The Black edition also includes the Wi-Fi remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.<p>The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HD HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
