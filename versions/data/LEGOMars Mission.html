The LEGO Mars Mission theme is a discontinued Space sub-theme that was sold from 2007 to 2009, focusing on a conflict between human astronauts and a hostile alien race on the Red Planet. The human mission was to mine powerful energy crystals, which the aliens also sought, leading to a war that was documented in an online real-time strategy game called CrystAlien Conflict. <p>Theme Overview and Story<p>The theme featured human astronauts with white and orange vehicles and a hostile, glow-in-the-dark green alien race. In contrast to its peaceful predecessor, Life on Mars (2001), this theme was a battleground. The human vehicles were often dual-purpose, with mining equipment that could be converted for battle, and many sets included a "pump system" feature that could transport crystals or aliens across the base. <p>The storyline, primarily found through supplementary materials like the website and the LEGO Battles Nintendo DS game, revolved around the humans discovering an alien hive on Olympus Mons and attempting to destroy it. <p>Notable Sets<p>The Mars Mission theme offered a variety of vehicles and bases for both the human astronauts and the aliens. <p>MB-01 Eagle Command Base (Set number: 7690): The main human base on Mars, featuring a command center, a space shuttle, and the pump system.<p>ETX Alien Mothership Assault (Set number: 7691): The alien headquarters which could split into several smaller ships: two Vipers, a Dragon Cruiser, and the main hull.<p>MT-201 Ultra-Drill Walker (Set number: 7649): A large, walking vehicle for the humans with a spinning laser drill and a detachable front section.<p>MX-81 Hypersonic Operations Aircraft (Set number: 7644): A large, flagship aircraft for the astronauts from the second wave of sets.<p>MT-61 Crystal Reaper (Set number: 7645): A mining vehicle that stumbled upon the alien hive in the storyline and had the function to pick up crystals. <p>Related Space Themes<p>Life on Mars (2001): The previous Mars theme that featured peaceful interactions between human explorers and native, friendly Martians.<p>Alien Conquest (2011): A later theme that, similar to Mars Mission, focused on humans (this time on Earth) battling hostile aliens.<p>LEGO City Space (Current): Modern space-themed sets within the LEGO City line, often inspired by real-world NASA missions and a focus on exploration, not conflict.
