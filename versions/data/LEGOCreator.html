In 1998, the term "LEGO Creator" was introduced not as a physical product line, but as the name for a sandbox-style video game that allowed users to build with virtual LEGO elements. The physical "Creator" theme was not launched until 2001. <p>The LEGO Creator Video Game (1998)<p>Released on November 11, 1998, the LEGO Creator video game was one of the first titles developed under the newly formed Lego Media International publishing division. <p>Gameplay: It was a sandbox game with no set objectives, missions, or challenges. Players had an unlimited supply of virtual bricks, primarily of the "Town" theme, to build whatever they desired.<p>Features:<p>Building: A point-and-click interface allowed users to select, rotate, and place bricks, as well as use pre-built models.<p>Customization: Players could also create custom minifigures and vehicles.<p>Perspective: Users could view their creations from a free-roaming camera perspective or from the perspective of a minifigure within the created world.<p>Availability: The original 1998 PC game is difficult to run on modern computers, though ISO images can be found on abandonware sites. <p>Physical Product Lines in 1998<p>While the "Creator" theme didn't exist as a physical line in 1998, LEGO's main offerings included the established "Basic" and "Freestyle" bucket sets, which also focused on general creativity and were the predecessors to the later Creator theme. Other major themes in 1998 included: <p>Adventurers: Egypt: The debut of the popular Johnny Thunder character, exploring pyramids and ruins.<p>Fright Knights: A gothic-style medieval castle sub-theme.<p>Space: Various space-exploration and sci-fi themes.<p>Town: The general city and public service sets.
