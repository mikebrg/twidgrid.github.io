The HERO10 Black was announced as the successor to the HERO9 Black on September 16, 2021.

The HERO10 Black essentially contained the features of the HERO9 Black, and improved on certain functions. Most notably, the "HyperSmooth" feature introduced in the HERO7 Black and refined in the HERO8 Black was improved on and named "HyperSmooth 4.0". Major changes included a new GP2 processor, the ability to shoot 5.3K video with double the frame rate, 23 MP photos, enhanced low-light performance and HyperSmooth 4.0 video stabilization in all modes.
<p>The HERO10 Black has an identical chassis to the HERO9 Black, and as such, accessories designed for the HERO9 are forwards compatible with the HERO10 and HERO11.
