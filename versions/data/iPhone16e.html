The iPhone 16e is a smartphone developed and marketed by Apple Inc. as part of its iPhone series. It is part of the eighteenth-generation iPhone line-up, together with the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, and the Pro models, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Announced on February 19, 2025, as part of the iPhone 16 lineup, the iPhone 16e was released with a starting price of US$599, marking a US$170 increase over the starting price of the iPhone SE (3rd generation), or a US$120 increase over the price of the comparable 128 GB of storage version of that iPhone.<p>The iPhone 16e is the entry-level model of the iPhone 16 lineup, featuring an edge-to-edge display (albeit retaining the iPhone 14's notch instead of the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 and 16 lines), Face ID, and a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It shares its dimensions and front design with the 2021 iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and 2022 iPhone 14. Compared to the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro, the iPhone 16e omits features such as Camera Control, an ultra-wide camera, an ultra-wideband chip, and support for Qi2 and MagSafe charging. The iPhone 16e is positioned similarly to the entry-level iPhone 5c, which launched alongside the iPhone 5s with fewer features, and subsequent iPhone SE models.<p>Powered by the A18 SoC (with 4 GPU cores instead of 5, unlike the regular iPhone 16), it features an action button replacing the mute switch, a single 48 MP Fusion camera with optical zoom options (1x and 2x), a custom Apple C1 cellular modem, and support for Apple Intelligence.<p>Following the iPhone 16e's announcement, the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE (3rd generation) were discontinued, completing the transition from Lightning to USB-C across all iPhone models starting with the iPhone 15.
