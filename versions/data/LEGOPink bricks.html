LEGO produces bricks in several shades of pink, although they are officially named by The LEGO Group with terms like "Bright Pink" (which fans call Light Pink) and "Dark Pink" (which fans call Bright Purple). These colors are widely available in various sets and as individual pieces. <p>Available Shades of Pink<p>LEGO has used various shades of pink throughout its history, with several being current and widely available: <p>Bright Pink (LEGO Color Name: Light Purple, Color ID 222): This is the most common current light pink shade, used extensively in themes like LEGO Friends and Classic.<p>Dark Pink (LEGO Color Name: Bright Purple, Color ID 221): A deeper, more saturated pink that is also a current and popular color.<p>Magenta (LEGO Color Name: Bright reddish violet, Color ID 124): Often perceived as a pinkish-purple, this vibrant color is also in current production.<p>Coral (Color ID 353): Introduced in 2019, this is a distinct, vibrant, warm pink/orange shade that is widely available. <p>Where to Find Pink Bricks<p>Pink bricks are commonly found in a variety of current products and through re-sellers.<p>Official LEGO Sets: Many current sets, especially in the LEGO Friends, Classic, and Botanical Collection lines, include a generous assortment of pink bricks.<p>Official LEGO Shop (Pick a Brick): You can often purchase individual pink elements directly from the official LEGO website's "Pick a Brick" service.<p>Third-Party Marketplaces: Websites like BrickLink and BrickOwl offer a vast selection of individual new and used pink bricks in all shapes and sizes from independent sellers. 
Fun Fact<p>LEGO Star Wars designers have a long-running inside joke where they try to hide a single pink brick in various sets, rewarding the successful "hider" with a pink cake. These internal bricks are typically hidden inside the model's structure, not meant to be seen.
