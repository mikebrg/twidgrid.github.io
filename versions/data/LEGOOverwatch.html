The LEGO Overwatch theme was a line of sets based on the Overwatch video game, first introduced in October 2018 and officially retired by December 31, 2020. A planned Overwatch 2 set was indefinitely delayed in 2022 due to the workplace misconduct lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, leaving the theme's future uncertain. <p>Overview<p>The LEGO Overwatch product line aimed to recreate the game's diverse cast of characters, iconic vehicles, and memorable locations in brick form. The sets were developed in a collaboration between Blizzard Entertainment and LEGO model designers, targeting both children for play and adult fans for display next to their gaming setups. <p>Released Sets<p>A total of nine sets (including one limited edition exclusive) were released in two waves between 2018 and 2019. 
Details on the released sets, including their set number, name, and included characters, can be found on Wikipedia. <p>Availability<p>Since the LEGO Overwatch theme is retired, the sets are no longer sold in official retail stores. Collectors can find these sets on the secondary market, which may result in higher prices compared to their original retail cost, especially for sealed items or the unreleased "Titan" set that has appeared on the market.
