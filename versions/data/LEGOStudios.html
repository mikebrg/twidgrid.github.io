The LEGO Studios theme was a discontinued product line from 2000 to 2003 that was based on moviemaking and special effects. It allowed builders to create their own stop-motion animations using software and webcams, and featured a tie-in with filmmaker Steven Spielberg. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The theme was a collaboration with Steven Spielberg, who was featured as a minifigure in some sets. The storyline centered on a film director, Art Director, and stunt personnel creating action-packed movies. The sets were designed to be versatile, featuring backdrops, props, and lighting elements to facilitate stop-motion animation. <p>Key Products and Features<p>Software and Webcams: The flagship product, the Steven Spielberg MovieMaker Set (set 1349), included a USB webcam and basic stop-motion animation software for Windows PCs, allowing users to film their own LEGO movies.<p>Sets as Movie Scenes: The sets themselves represented various movie scenes and genres:<p>The Jurassic Park Connection: Many sets tied into a Jurassic Park theme, featuring T-Rex dinosaurs, camera crew minifigures, and vehicles.<p>Action and Stunts: Sets like Stunt Team (set 1353) and Adventure Team (set 1354) included vehicles, ramps, and crash features.<p>Monster Scenes: Later sets in 2002-2003 shifted towards a monster movie theme with vampires, mummies, and skeletons.<p>Minifigures: The theme included a wide range of minifigures, including directors, camera operators, stuntmen, actors, and various monsters and animals. <p>Discontinuation and Legacy<p>The LEGO Studios theme was discontinued in 2003.
