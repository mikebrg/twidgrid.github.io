The LEGO Paradisa theme was a popular, discontinued sub-theme of the LEGO Town line that ran from 1992 to 1997. It was marketed primarily toward girls and focused on a vacation and leisure lifestyle, featuring beach scenes, cafés, and horse stables. <p>Theme Overview<p>The sets emphasized a relaxing, social atmosphere and were known for a unique pastel color scheme that heavily featured pink, white, and light green. Paradisa was the first major attempt by The LEGO Group to target a female market since the Homemaker theme in the 1980s. <p>Aesthetic: The theme introduced many pink-colored bricks and other rare pieces not commonly found in the more action-oriented themes of the time. It also made generous use of large, decorated baseplates, often featuring pool or stone path designs.<p>Minifigures: The theme was notable for featuring an abundance of female minifigures with new, more detailed facial expressions, varied hair pieces (like the ponytail), and unique torso designs compared to other themes of the era. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are no longer produced by LEGO and can only be acquired through re-sellers. <p>Poolside Paradise (6416): The flagship house set, featuring a two-story villa with a swimming pool, a car, and multiple minifigures.<p>Sand Dollar Café (6411): A popular café and restaurant set located on the beach, featuring a coffee machine and a lifeguard tower.<p>Dolphin Point (6414): A set centered around a lighthouse, boat, and dolphin figures, emphasizing the coastal setting.<p>Rolling Acres Ranch (6419): One of the larger sets, focusing on horseback riding with stables, fences, and horse figures.<p>Sunset Stables (6405): A simpler stable set that included a horse and a 4x4 vehicle.<p>Sidewalk Café (6402): A small set that included an ice cream parlor, an outdoor seating area, and two minifigures. <p>Legacy<p>While discontinued, the Paradisa theme remains a nostalgic favorite for many collectors and has been subtly referenced in modern sets, such as a minifigure wearing a "Paradisa" T-shirt in a 2025 LEGO Ideas set. The modern LEGO Friends theme can be seen as a spiritual successor, also featuring a wide range of everyday life scenarios and vibrant colors.
