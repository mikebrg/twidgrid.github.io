LEGO Technic robots controlled by computers

LEGO offers two main systems for building Technic robots controlled by computers or smart devices: the educational SPIKE Prime system (using computers) and the consumer CONTROL+ and Powered Up systems (primarily using apps). The highly popular Mindstorms theme, which previously allowed direct computer control, was discontinued in 2022. <p>Educational Solutions (Computer Control)<p>The primary method for computer-controlled Technic-based robots today is the LEGO Education line, specifically SPIKE Prime. <p>LEGO Education SPIKE Prime: This system uses a programmable "hub" (a small computer/microcontroller), motors, and sensors.<p>Software: The SPIKE App can be installed on Windows, macOS, or Chromebook computers, or used via a web browser.<p>Programming Languages: It supports drag-and-drop block coding based on Scratch, and text-based coding using MicroPython, allowing for advanced programming directly from a computer.<p>Third-Party Solutions (Pybricks): For more advanced control and flexibility, the free and open-source Pybricks firmware and programming environment can be loaded onto compatible LEGO hubs, including those used in SPIKE Prime, Boost, City, and Technic themes.<p>Platform Compatibility: Pybricks allows coding using Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, and Android, and running programs directly on the hub. <p>Consumer Solutions (App Control)<p>For standard consumer LEGO Technic sets, control is typically managed via apps on smartphones or tablets, not directly from a desktop computer application. <p>CONTROL+: This system is used in many large Technic sets to provide realistic controls, automation, and real-time feedback via Bluetooth connection to a smart device.<p>Sets: Examples include the Liebherr Crawler Crane LR 13000 (set 42146) and the Audi RS Q e-tron (set 42160).<p>Computer Use: To use the app on a PC or Mac, you would typically need to use an Android emulator like BlueStacks.<p>Powered Up: This system is used in some Technic and City trains/vehicles and also connects to an app or a physical remote control via Bluetooth. <p>Discontinued Themes<p>LEGO Mindstorms: This long-running and highly popular line (1998-2022) offered excellent computer control options throughout its history, with software for programming the programmable "bricks" via USB or Bluetooth from a PC. It has been officially discontinued.
