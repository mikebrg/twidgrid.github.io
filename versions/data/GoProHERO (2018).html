The HERO (2018 edition) was announced on March 29, 2018 intended as an entry-level camera alongside the HERO6 Black. The new model offers some similar features and functionality to the HERO5 Black and HERO6 Black, including a touchscreen and built-in time-lapse video mode, but with slightly lower resolution and frame-rate, and lacking the GPS functionality and exposure control; because the hardware is identical to that of the HERO5, the firmware can be modified to include the GoPro HERO5 Black's capabilities.
