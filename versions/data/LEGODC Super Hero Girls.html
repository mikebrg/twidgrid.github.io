LEGO DC Super Hero Girls was a discontinued LEGO theme that ran from late 2016 to 2018, based on the animated web series of the same name. The product line was unique for featuring mini-doll figures rather than traditional minifigures and aimed to appeal to a younger female audience with sets centered around a high school for superheroes. <p>Characters and Format<p>The theme reimagined popular DC characters as students at Super Hero High School, incorporating both heroes and villains in heroic roles. The figures used the mini-doll format, which has proportions similar to characters from the LEGO Friends and LEGO Disney Princess themes. <p>Key characters in the sets included:<p>Heroes: Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Batgirl, Bumblebee, Harley Quinn, and Poison Ivy.<p>Villains: Eclipso, Lashina, Lena Luthor, and Mad Harriet.<p>Other: Steve Trevor, Krypto the Superdog, and the small "Kryptomites" creatures that served as minor antagonists. <p>Notable Sets<p>A total of 12 sets (including promotional polybags) were released in two waves during 2016 and 2017. The sets focused on locations, vehicles, and action scenarios. <p>Super Hero High School (41232): The main location set, featuring classrooms, a lab, and a focus on school life.<p>Eclipso Dark Palace (41239): The largest set in the theme, featuring the main villain's lair and the Flash mini-doll.<p>Batgirl Batjet Chase (41230) and Bumblebee Helicopter (41234): Smaller sets focused on character-specific vehicles.<p>Wonder Woman Dorm Room (41235) and Harley Quinn Dorm (41236): Smaller, more affordable sets focusing on the characters' personal spaces. <p>Supporting Media<p>The toy line was supported by a variety of tie-in media, including: <p>Animated shorts and webisodes on YouTube.<p>Two direct-to-video animated films: LEGO DC Super Hero Girls: Brain Drain (2017) and LEGO DC Super Hero Girls: Super-Villain High (2018). <p>The LEGO DC Super Hero Girls theme was discontinued by the end of 2018, but individual figures and retired sets can still be found through secondary marketplaces and independent sellers.
