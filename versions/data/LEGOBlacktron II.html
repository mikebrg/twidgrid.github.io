The black cockpits were removable and designed to fit into multiple different vehicles, encouraging mix-and-match building and creating larger, more versatile ships.<p>Minifigures: The minifigures featured visors, sleek black uniforms with green accents, and specific blacktron logos, giving them a distinct, villainous appearance. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are now highly sought-after collector's items and are only available on the secondary market from re-sellers. <p>Blacktron II Blacktron Flagship (6981): The flagship set and main mobile base of operations, this large ship could separate into several smaller vessels and housed multiple cockpit pods.<p>Blacktron II Spectral Starguider (6979): A large space cruiser with a unique design and the modular cockpit system.<p>Raptor Rover (6887): A ground-based rover with a large radar dish and a magnetic crane system for picking up cargo.<p>Aerial Intruder (6851): A smaller, basic flying vehicle with a cockpit pod. <p>Legacy and Related Themes<p>Blacktron I (1987-1988): The original black-and-yellow space villain faction.<p>Space Police II (1992-1993): The primary antagonist faction in this storyline.<p>Modern Homage: In 2022, as part of the LEGO Group's 90th-anniversary celebrations, the Galaxy Explorer (10497) set included minifigure torsos with the classic Blacktron II logo as a direct homage to the fan-favorite theme.<p>LEGO Universe MMORPG: The online game "LEGO Universe" featured Blacktron as a playable faction and built upon its story and designs.
