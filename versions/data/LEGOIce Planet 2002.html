The LEGO Ice Planet 2002 theme (often shortened to Ice Planet) was a popular, discontinued sub-theme of the LEGO Space line that ran from 1993 to 1994. It focused on a team of human scientists and explorers on the frozen planet Krysto, where they mined valuable "laser" or "energy" crystals. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The storyline depicted a group of highly specialized explorers, identifiable by their uniform white, blue, and orange color scheme. They operated various vehicles designed for icy terrain and sub-zero temperatures, with the goal of harvesting the unique transparent-orange crystals needed for powering their operations. <p>Key features of the sets included:<p>Color Scheme: The bright orange and transparent orange elements were iconic to the theme.<p>Equipment: Vehicles often included skis, snow treads, radar dishes, and holders designed to "fire" or launch the precious energy crystals.<p>Minifigures: The minifigures included commanders and scientists with detailed torso printing.<p>Magnetic Cranes: Many sets incorporated the use of a magnetic crane system to pick up the energy crystals, which was a core play feature. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are now highly sought-after collector's items and are only available on the secondary market from re-sellers.<p>Ice Station Odyssey (6984): The flagship set and main base of operations, it featured a large, central station with a rotating radar dish, a launchpad, and several vehicles, including a small space shuttle.<p>Deep Freeze Defender (6973): The main spacecraft of the theme, it could split into a large ship and a smaller, wheeled rover for ground exploration.<p>Ice-Traction Hovercraft (6892): A ground-based hovercraft with a magnetic crane system for picking up crystals.<p>Ice Tunnelator (6810): A small set featuring a simple drilling vehicle for mining. <p>Legacy and Related Themes<p>Spyrius (1994-1996) & Unitron (1994-1995): The themes that immediately followed Ice Planet, focusing on a spy storyline and modular technology.<p>Arctic (2014) & Arctic Explorers (2024): The LEGO City line has several times revisited the "Arctic" theme, featuring modern-day exploration and scientific discovery, serving as a spiritual successor in the "realistic" space of the LEGO universe.
