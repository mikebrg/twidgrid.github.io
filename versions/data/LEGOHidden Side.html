LEGO Hidden Side was a discontinued theme that combined physical LEGO building sets with an interactive augmented reality (AR) app experience. Launched in August 2019, the theme took place in the fictional town of Newbury, where players used their mobile devices to hunt and capture virtual ghosts overlaid on their physical sets. <p>Theme Concept<p>The core concept of LEGO Hidden Side was "fluid play," an attempt to link the digital and real world. The sets were designed to look like ordinary urban buildings, vehicles, and locations that could physically transform to reveal "haunted" features and ghostly elements. <p>Key features of the concept included:<p>Augmented Reality (AR) App: The free companion app (available on iOS and Android until its discontinuation in 2023) was central to the experience. Pointing a smartphone at a set revealed a hidden digital world with challenges, "gloom" to collect, and ghosts to capture.<p>Interactive Sets: Many sets included a physical color wheel or transforming parts that, when manipulated, changed the AR gameplay on the screen.<p>Storyline & Characters: The theme followed two teenage ghost hunters, Jack Davids and Parker L. Jackson, along with scientist Dr. J.B. Watt and the ghost dog Spencer, as they battled a variety of ghosts and boss spirits. The story was expanded through an animated web series and a TV special. <p>Notable Sets<p>A total of 32 playsets and promotional packs were released between 2019 and 2020. <p>Newbury Haunted High School (70425): A flagship set that could transform from a regular school building into a giant ghost face, featuring detailed interiors like a cafeteria and science lab.<p>Paranormal Intercept Bus 3000 (70423): A heavily modified school bus used as a mobile ghost lab, praised for its functional play features and multiple minifigures.<p>Mystery Castle (70437): One of the largest sets in the theme, featuring hinged towers and secret doors, popular for its detailed build and castle-themed elements.<p>Wrecked Shrimp Boat (70419) / Shrimp Shack Attack (70422): These sets featured unique, spooky designs of a boat and a diner that could transform into haunted versions. <p>Availability<p>The LEGO Hidden Side product line was discontinued by the end of 2020. As the sets are retired and the companion app has been discontinued since 2023, they are no longer available for official retail purchase. Collectors can find both new and used sets, as well as individual minifigures and parts, through secondary market sources such as online marketplaces and specialized brick retailers.
