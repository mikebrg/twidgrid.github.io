LEGO Hero Factory was a core, "constraction" (constructible action figure) product line that ran from 2010 to 2014, effectively succeeding the popular LEGO Bionicle theme. It centered on an elite agency that built and deployed robotic heroes to maintain peace across the galaxy. <p>Overview<p>The theme shifted from Bionicle's complex lore to a more straightforward action-hero premise. The heroes were built at the "Hero Factory" in Makuhero City and were deployed via mission-specific briefings across a vast multimedia franchise. The sets utilized the LEGO Technic-based "Character and Creature Building System" (CCBS), which emphasized ball joints and large armor plates for high articulation and quick building. <p>Storytelling: The narrative was told through online games, animated web episodes and TV specials on Cartoon Network, comics, and books.<p>Collectibility: The sets were designed to be built quickly and modified, and the parts were highly interchangeable, encouraging creative building and customization. <p>Factions and Characters<p>The Heroes: The main protagonists were a range of robotic heroes, including the core team of Furno, Stormer, Bulk, Stringer, Breez, and Surge, led by veteran heroes like Preston Stormer and the factory head, Mr. Makuro.<p>The Villains: The heroes battled a variety of villains, including:
Villain Factory Escapees<p>The Fire Villains (led by Von Nebula)<p>Witch Doctor<p>The Savage Planet Beasts<p>The Evil Brains (alien parasites that possessed creatures) <p>Construction Sets<p>Over 100 sets were released in total, across different waves and story arcs. Key sets included: <p>Von Nebula (7169): A large, imposing figure representing the main antagonist of the first year's storyline.<p>Witch Doctor (2283): A powerful villain figure from the "Savage Planet" arc.<p>Fire Lord (2289): A boss-level villain figure from the "Fire Villains" arc.<p>Bulk & Stringer (6232): A double-pack set from the "Breakout" wave that included two heroes and was praised for its value.<p>Brain Attack Sets: The 2014 wave that featured evil alien brains attaching to and controlling large creature figures. <p>Legacy and Status
The LEGO Hero Factory theme was officially discontinued in 2014 to make way for the highly anticipated relaunch of the LEGO Bionicle theme in 2015. Many of the building system elements (CCBS) pioneered in Hero Factory were subsequently used in Bionicle's second generation and in numerous other licensed themes like Star Wars buildable figures. The sets are now retired and found on secondary marketplaces.
