The original LEGO Vikings was a popular, discontinued theme from 2005 to 2007 that featured Viking warriors battling creatures from Norse mythology. While the original theme is retired, the Viking concept has recently returned in new, standalone sets within the LEGO Ideas and Creator 3-in-1 themes. <p><p>Discontinued Original Vikings Theme (2005-2007)<p>This theme included seven main sets, all centered around a "warrior vs. monster" storyline, and was noted for its use of Bionicle and Technic pieces to build the large mythical creatures. <p>Viking Fortress against the Fafnir Dragon (Set number: 7019): The largest set in the theme, featuring a fortress inspired by real Danish ring fortresses, a catapult, drawbridge, and a dragon.<p>Viking Ship Challenges the Midgard Serpent (Set number: 7018): Included a detailed Viking longboat with shields and oars, a Viking King minifigure, and the articulated Midgard Serpent creature.<p>Viking Warrior Challenges the Fenris Wolf (Set number: 7015): An action-packed set featuring a warrior and the fearsome Fenris Wolf.
Viking Boat against the Wyvern Dragon (Set number: 7016): A smaller longboat used to fight a flying Wyvern Dragon.<p>Army of Vikings with Heavy Artillery (Set number: 7020): Included a large artillery wagon with a working launcher and projectiles. <p>Modern Viking Sets (Current)<p>Due to fan demand, LEGO has released new, detailed sets that capture the spirit of the original theme, often with more historical accuracy (e.g., no horns on the helmets). <p>Viking Village (Set number: 21343):<p>This set was a fan idea that became a reality through the LEGO Ideas platform.<p>It features four structures: a blacksmith's smithy with a functioning bellows, a chieftain's longhouse, a watchtower, and a cave for mineral mining.<p>It includes four minifigures: a chieftain, a blacksmith, an archer, and a shield-maiden, with authentic details in their clothing and shield designs.<p>Viking Ship and the Midgard Serpent (Set number: 31132):<p>Part of the Creator 3-in-1 line, this set offers three possible builds: a traditional Viking longship with a brick-built Midgard Serpent, a Viking house with a small dragon, or a large Fenris Wolf.<p>It is designed with a high level of detail, including fabric sails, shields printed with Odin's ravens, and a functional catapult.
