The LEGO Mindstorms NXT 1.0 (set number 8527) is a discontinued programmable robotics kit that was released in 2006 and replaced by the NXT 2.0 in 2009. It served as a comprehensive platform for learning robotics and basic programming concepts. <p>Key Components<p>The set included 577 Technic elements and several electronic components for building and programming autonomous robots. <p>NXT Intelligent Brick: The "brain" of the robot, this programmable brick features a 32-bit microprocessor, four input ports for sensors, three output ports for motors, a 100x64 pixel monochrome LCD, a speaker, USB 2.0 connectivity, and Bluetooth support. It is powered by six AA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack (sold separately).<p>Motors: The kit came with three interactive servo motors that have integrated rotation sensors to provide precise positioning feedback and speed control.<p>Sensors: The set included a variety of sensors to help the robot interact with its environment:<p>Touch Sensor: Detects physical contact (pressed or released).<p>Light Sensor: Measures light intensity using an integrated red LED for reflected light or ambient light.<p>Sound Sensor: Measures ambient noise levels in both decibels (dB) and dBA.<p>Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the distance to an object and detects movement. <p>Programming<p>The NXT 1.0 used the NXT-G software, a user-friendly, icon-based drag-and-drop programming language based on LabVIEW from National Instruments. This allowed users, including beginners, to create programs with loops, conditional statements, and sensor input logic. A variety of third-party programming languages like NXC, NBC, leJOS, and RobotC were also developed by the active community for more advanced users. <p>Building<p>The set's Technic elements and electronic components were designed to build various introductory robots. Building instructions for the primary models were included in the software. Notable models included: <p>Tribot: A basic wheeled robot, the "starter model".<p>Spike: A six-legged, scorpion-like robot with a retractable tail.<p>Roboarm T-56: A robotic arm with three degrees of freedom.<p>Alpha Rex: The most complex model, a two-legged humanoid robot that used every sensor and motor in the set.
