LEGO Primo series
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The LEGO Primo series (sometimes branded as LEGO Baby) was a discontinued product line launched in 1995 and available until around 1998. It was the earliest and largest LEGO building system, designed specifically for infants and toddlers aged 3 to 24 months. <p>Theme Overview and Features<p>Size: Primo bricks were the largest building elements ever produced by the LEGO Group, even larger than DUPLO and Quatro bricks. They were designed to be safe and easy for infants to hold and play with.<p>Safety: The bricks had smooth, rounded edges and no small parts to ensure they were safe for very young children. The material was a slightly softer, more flexible plastic than standard LEGO or DUPLO.<p>Compatibility: The system was not compatible with standard LEGO, DUPLO, or Quatro bricks, as its size was entirely unique and the focus was on the simple stacking of a few core shapes.<p>Characters: The logo and main character for the theme was a friendly blue elephant.<p>Play Features: Many sets included rattles or squeaker bricks to provide sensory stimulation for infants. The pieces were durable and washable, intended for early childhood development. <p>Discontinued Sets and Products<p>The Primo series had a limited number of sets, primarily focused on basic shapes and animal themes. They are no longer available new from official retailers but can be found through re-sellers or on online auction sites. <p>Primo Rattle Ball (set 2050): A simple ball made of the soft plastic that could be taken apart.<p>Primo Blocks (set 2030, etc.): Basic sets of large, colorful stacking bricks.<p>Elephant (set 2051): A set to build the iconic blue elephant character.<p>Sound Bricks (set 2021, etc.): Sets that included bricks with built-in rattles or squeakers. <p>Successor Themes<p>The Primo line was discontinued and its purpose was largely absorbed by the LEGO DUPLO line, which has a wider range of products and a better-established brand recognition for toddlers aged 18 months and up.
