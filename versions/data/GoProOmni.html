The Omni also was announced in May 2015, leveraging its recent acquisition of Kolor, which developed software to stitch video footage together; Omni was a camera rig that synchronizes six GoPro HERO4 Black cameras, allowing users to stitch and make virtual reality 360° videos. Omni began shipping in August 2016.
