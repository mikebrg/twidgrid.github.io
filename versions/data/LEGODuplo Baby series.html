LEGO Duplo Baby series
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
In 1983, The LEGO Group launched a sub-theme of the DUPLO line officially called LEGO DUPLO Baby (or just "Baby" on some records). This series included simple, large pieces and items like rattles and bath toys designed for the youngest children. <p>1983 DUPLO Baby Products <p>The 1983 sets were designed with the safety of infants and toddlers in mind, featuring smooth, large pieces that were less likely to be swallowed. The range was focused on basic play and sensory stimulation. <p>Oval Rattle (Set number: 2015): A simple oval-shaped rattle toy with a few bricks.<p>Duck Rattle/Teether Toy (Set number: 2024): A baby duck-shaped rattle and teether toy.<p>Spinning Rattle Set (Set number: 2037): A set with a spinning feature to engage infants.<p>Activity and Bath Toy (Set number: 2038): A 2-piece set featuring a fish figure that could float on water and rattle, designed for bath time play. <p>General DUPLO Innovations in 1983 <p>In 1983, the broader DUPLO line also saw significant innovations, although these were aimed at a slightly older toddler demographic (1.5-5 years) than the specific Baby line: <p>DUPLO Figures: Figures were introduced that had movable heads, arms, and legs, resembling larger versions of the classic LEGO minifigures but remaining non-disassemblable for safety.<p>DUPLO Trains: The first DUPLO train sets were introduced, a system that would become a classic of the line. <p>The LEGO DUPLO Baby line was eventually discontinued and later replaced in the mid-1990s by the separate LEGO Primo theme, which continued the concept of extra-large bricks for infants.
