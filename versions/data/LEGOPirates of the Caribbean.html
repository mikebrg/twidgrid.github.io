The LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean theme is a licensed product line based on the successful film franchise. It had initial runs from 2011 to 2017 and has recently been revived with new adult collector sets in 2025. <p>Overview<p>The theme replaced the general LEGO Pirates theme and brought the specific characters, ships, and locations from the Pirates of the Caribbean films to life in LEGO form. The sets were known for their detailed designs, numerous minifigures, and iconic ship models like the Black Pearl and Queen Anne's Revenge. The product line also included a popular video game that covered the storylines of the first four films. <p>Construction Sets<p>The theme includes various sets released across different waves, with recent additions aimed at adult collectors: <p>The Black Pearl (4184): A highly sought-after set from 2011, featuring the main pirate ship captained by Jack Sparrow and Barbossa, with 804 pieces and six minifigures.<p>Queen Anne's Revenge (4195): The largest set in the initial 2011 wave, a detailed model of Blackbeard's ship with 1,094 pieces and nine minifigures.<p>Silent Mary (71042): Released in 2017 to coincide with the Dead Men Tell No Tales film, this large, detailed ghost ship model had 2,294 pieces and eight minifigures.<p>Captain Jack Sparrow's Pirate Ship (10365): A new LEGO Icons set released in September 2025, this is an updated, large-scale (2,826 pieces) version of the Black Pearl aimed at adult builders. <p>Video Game<p>LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game: Released in May 2011 to coincide with the fourth film, this action-adventure game was developed by Traveller's Tales and adapted the plots of the first four films. It allowed players to explore familiar locations, solve puzzles, engage in sword fights, and play as over 70 different characters from the franchise. <p>Collectibility<p>Many of the original sets, especially the large ships, are now retired and considered highly collectible items. They are primarily available on secondary marketplaces, as only new collector sets are currently sold through official channels.
