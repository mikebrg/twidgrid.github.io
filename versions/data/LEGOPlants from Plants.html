LEGO Plants from Plants
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
Plants from Plants is not a conventional LEGO building theme, but rather an environmental initiative launched by the LEGO Group to produce specific "botanical" elements using plant-based plastic sourced from sustainably grown sugarcane. <p>Initiative Details<p>The program represents the LEGO Group's commitment to using sustainable materials in all core products and packaging by 2030. <p>Material: The plant-based plastic is polyethylene, which is a soft, durable, and flexible plastic made from ethanol produced from sustainably sourced sugarcane.<p>Quality: The new elements are technically and visually identical to existing LEGO elements made from conventional plastic. Children and parents will not notice any difference in quality or appearance.<p>Non-biodegradable: The plant-based plastic is not biodegradable, as the LEGO Group wants its products to be durable and reusable across generations.<p>Scale: These botanical elements (leaves, bushes, and trees) constitute about 1-2% of the total amount of plastic elements produced by the LEGO Group. <p>Specific Product<p>The initiative was highlighted in a specific promotional set, the LEGO Plants from Plants (40320) set, which was offered as a gift-with-purchase in August 2018. This small set was a collection of these new sustainable elements. <p>Current Status<p>These plant-based elements are now integrated into a wide range of LEGO products, particularly within the popular adult-focused LEGO Botanical Collection sets, which include the Bonsai Tree (10281) and Flower Bouquet (10280). These sets utilize the plant-based plastic elements for their various leaves and plant structures.
