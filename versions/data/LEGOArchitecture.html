The LEGO Architecture theme is an ongoing product line, launched in 2008, that features detailed, micro-scale brick models of famous global landmarks and city skylines. The line is designed for older children and adults interested in architecture, history, and travel, with sets including informative booklets about the real-world buildings. <p>Overview<p>The theme celebrates past, present, and future architecture and originated from the work of Chicago architect Adam Reed Tucker, who began creating large-scale models of skyscrapers with LEGO bricks in 2006. The current line is divided into three categories: <p>Landmark Series: Focuses on individual iconic buildings like the Statue of Liberty or the Great Pyramid of Giza.<p>Architect Series: Recreates architecturally significant buildings such as Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater.<p>Skyline Collection: Combines multiple landmarks from a single city into a cohesive model, such as the New York City or London skylines. <p>Notable Sets (Current and Upcoming)<p>The LEGO Architecture line currently features a range of display-worthy sets, with new releases planned for 2025 and 2026. <p>Himeji Castle (21060): A detailed model of the Japanese castle released in August 2023.<p>Notre-Dame de Paris (21061): An intricate model of the famous cathedral.<p>Great Pyramid of Giza (21058): A unique set that is a cross-section model, revealing interior chambers and the construction process.<p>Trevi Fountain (21062): A detailed remake of the Roman landmark released in March 2025.<p>Neuschwanstein Castle (21063): A large set of the famous German castle released in August 2025.<p>Paris – City of Love (21064): An upcoming 2026 set that blends the Skyline and Postcard formats with an elevated approach to key Parisian landmarks. <p>Collectibility<p>Many older LEGO Architecture sets, such as the original Sears Tower (Willis Tower) from 2008, are now retired and have become highly sought-after collector's items on the secondary market. The sets generally hold their value well after retirement, making them a popular choice for adult fans and collectors.
