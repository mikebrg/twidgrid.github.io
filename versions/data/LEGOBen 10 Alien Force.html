The LEGO Ben 10: Alien Force theme was a short-lived, discontinued product line released in January 2010 that featured buildable action figures based on the Cartoon Network animated series. The theme was largely unsuccessful with buyers and was discontinued by the end of 2010 after only one wave of sets. <p>Overview<p>The sets used large, specialized pieces, similar to those found in LEGO Bionicle or Hero Factory themes, to create articulated figures of the aliens from the show. Each set represented one alien transformation that Ben Tennyson could use. A key feature was that parts from different sets could be combined to create unique, "morphed" super aliens, encouraging imaginative play. <p>Construction Sets<p>Only six individual buildable figures were released in the theme. Each retailed for an original price of $14.99 and is now a collector's item. <p>Spidermonkey (8409): A figure with a unique head mold and four arms.<p>Swampfire (8410): Features a large build and glow-in-the-dark eyes and Omnitrix symbol.<p>Chromastone (8411): A crystal-like alien figure with glow-in-the-dark features.<p>Humungousaur (8517): A large, powerful alien figure, also with glow-in-the-dark features.<p>Jet Ray (8518): A flying alien with wings and a sleek design.<p>Big Chill (8519): An alien figure with large wings that were part of its cape structure. <p>Collectibility<p>As a retired theme, all LEGO Ben 10: Alien Force sets are no longer available in standard retail stores. They can be found on secondary marketplaces like eBay and BrickLink, where their value is often significantly higher than the original retail price due to their rarity and the show's cult following.
