LEGO features trees in two main forms: pre-designed display sets as part of the adult-oriented Botanical Collection, and individual plant and leaf elements for builders to create their own custom landscapes. <p>Official LEGO Tree Sets<p>Official sets that feature trees are primarily display models, known for their detail and innovative use of pieces. <p>LEGO Bonsai Tree (10281): This set for adults is a popular display piece in the LEGO Botanical Collection. It includes interchangeable pieces to style the tree with traditional green leaves or vibrant pink cherry blossoms.<p>LEGO Japanese Red Maple Bonsai Tree (10348): A newer addition to the Botanical Collection, this set features gorgeous red and amber-colored leaves for an autumn display.<p>LEGO Icons Tiny Plants (10423): This set includes nine different buildable plants, providing a mix of smaller, diverse botanical options for display. <p>Custom Building Elements<p>For those who want to build their own landscapes or populate a custom city, LEGO offers a wide assortment of individual plant elements that can be bought separately. <p>Leaf Plates and Elements: A huge variety of specific parts are available, from small 1x1 round plates with a flower edge to large 6x5 leaf elements.<p>Stems and Trunks: Specialized stem pieces (e.g., Plant Flower Stem with Bar and 6 Stems (19119)) and trunk pieces (Plant Tree Palm Trunk (2536)) are used to construct the structure of the tree.<p>"Plants from Plants" Initiative: Many modern leaf and plant elements are now made from plant-based plastic, produced using sustainably sourced sugarcane. <p>Building Techniques
The LEGO community (AFOLs) has developed countless innovative techniques for building realistic custom trees using standard pieces, which often look more lifelike than simple official designs: <p>Standard Tree Design: A common simple technique involves stacking brown round bricks for a trunk and attaching green slope pieces or specific tree elements (like the "spruce tree" part) for the foliage.<p>Advanced Techniques: Master builders use various pieces, from large plant plates to small 1x1 round plates to achieve a full, bushy look for their trees, which can range from pine trees to palm trees.
