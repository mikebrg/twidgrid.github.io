LEGO Loco is a classic, discontinued sandbox simulation PC game from 1998 that focused on building towns and intricate rail transport systems for LEGO minifigures.

Players could pick up and move minifigures and vehicles around the map.<p>Easter Eggs: The game was known for a number of hidden interactions, such as placing four fountains together to create a rainbow or specific building combinations invoking the Loch Ness Monster.<p>Multiplayer and Postcards: The game included a multiplayer mode and a unique feature allowing players to design and send virtual postcards to others over a dial-up internet connection.<p>Minifigure Language: The Station Master and other characters spoke in a distinctive "Lego-ese" language of mumbles and speech bubbles, adding to the game's charm.

It is not available on digital storefronts like Steam or GOG, though there are active fan communities and independent developers working on modern remakes. <p>Physical Copies: Original boxed copies or discs can occasionally be found on online auction sites like eBay.<p>Digital Copies: Because it is considered abandonware, digital versions can be found through various third-party websites.
