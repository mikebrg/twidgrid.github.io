LEGO Clikits was a discontinued arts-and-crafts product line from 2003 to 2006 that was specifically aimed at girls for creating customizable jewelry, accessories, and room decorations. The sets focused on a "click" system where colorful parts could be easily snapped together. <p>Theme Overview<p>The line was the fourth major LEGO theme targeted specifically toward a female audience, following themes like Scala and Belville. The core concept involved small, often colorful and transparent "icons" with male or female connectors that could be "clicked" into various base items like bracelets, necklaces, key chains, photo frames, and storage containers. <p>While many of the pieces were unique to the theme, most were compatible with the standard LEGO system, which allowed for creative integration into existing builds. The vibrant color palette included several colors that were exclusive to the Clikits theme at the time of its release. <p>Key Products<p>The Clikits line included a wide variety of sets, many of which came in distinctive packaging with carrying cases or storage features. <p>Jewelry and Fashion Accessories: These were the primary focus of the line and included parts to make:<p>Bracelets and necklaces using strings and beads.<p>Hair clips and hairbands.<p>Purses and fashion bags.<p>Room Decor: Sets designed to decorate a personal space:<p>Photo frames and mirrors.<p>Storage containers and desk sets.<p>Pillow decor and wall hangings. <p>Discontinuation<p>The Clikits line was discontinued in 2006, though some accessories were available in specific regions until 2008. Despite being popular during its run, the theme was eventually retired, and no new sets have been produced since. The spiritual successor to this arts-and-crafts concept for a similar demographic can be seen in the modern LEGO DOTS theme (2020-2023).
