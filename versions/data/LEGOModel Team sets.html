The LEGO Model Team theme was a popular, advanced, discontinued product line that ran from 1986 to 1999, with a small revival in 2004. It focused on creating highly detailed, realistic vehicle models using standard LEGO bricks (System) rather than the more technical pieces found in the Technic line. <p>Theme Overview and Features<p>Model Team sets were aimed at experienced builders and adult fans, offering a more challenging and rewarding building experience. <p>Realism and Detail: The primary focus was on creating authentic-looking replicas of cars, trucks, and planes, with a high level of detail in the chassis, interiors, and exteriors.<p>Playability: Despite the focus on realism, many models included functional play features like working steering, opening hoods and doors, and detailed engines.<p>Alternate Builds: Like many classic LEGO themes, the larger sets often included instructions or ideas for building two or three completely different models from the same bricks. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are now highly sought-after collector's items and are only available on the secondary market from re-sellers. <p>Truck (5580): The flagship set of the original 1986 launch, a large, detailed semi-truck in blue and white, which set the standard for the entire line.<p>Highway Haulers (5590): A large, detailed semi-truck with a bright red cab and a large flatbed trailer, released in 1990.<p>Red Turbo Racer (5541): A popular sports car set from 1992, known for its sleek design and functional steering.<p>Blaze Attack (5510): A fire truck model from 1997 with a functional water pump and hose system.<p>Sonic Boom (5592): A large, detailed airplane model released in 1998, featuring a working landing gear mechanism. <p>Legacy and Modern Successors<p>The Model Team line was eventually discontinued, but its core principles live on in several modern LEGO themes:<p>LEGO Creator Expert / Icons: The current line of advanced, highly detailed vehicle models, such as the LEGO Icons Chevrolet Camaro Z28 and Volkswagen T2 Camper Van, are the direct spiritual successors to the Model Team line.<p>LEGO Technic: While Technic uses different building elements, its focus on detailed vehicle functionality and realism appeals to a similar audience.<p>LEGO Speed Champions: This current line focuses on smaller, minifigure-scale, detailed replicas of real-world supercars.
