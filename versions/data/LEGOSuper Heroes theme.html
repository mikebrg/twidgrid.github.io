The LEGO Super Heroes theme, launched in 2012 (with promotional releases in late 2011), is an ongoing, licensed product line that encompasses sets based on both the DC Universe and the Marvel Universe comics and films. <p>Overview<p>The "Super Heroes" umbrella theme was created to house the various licensed superhero properties from both major comic book publishers. Since 2019, the "Super Heroes" logo has largely been dropped in favor of specific "LEGO Marvel" and "LEGO DC" branding, though it remains the overall theme under which these operate. The line features: <p>Minifigures: Recreations of iconic heroes and villains such as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, Spider-Man, The Hulk, and many more.<p>Vehicles and Locations: Brick-built versions of key locations and vehicles, including the Avengers' Helicarrier, Stark Tower, the Batcave, the Daily Bugle, and the Batmobile.<p>Multimedia: The theme has spawned several successful video games, including LEGO Marvel Super Heroes and LEGO Batman games, as well as animated shorts and films. <p>Sub-themes and Key Characters<p>LEGO DC<p>This sub-theme has a history dating back to the standalone LEGO Batman line (2006-2008) before officially joining the Super Heroes brand in 2012. <p>Characters: Key characters include Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Joker, Harley Quinn, and Lex Luthor. The line heavily features Batman and associated characters and locations like Gotham City.<p>Sets: Sets range from smaller vehicle chases to massive, detailed display models like the LEGO DC Batman: The Animated Series Gotham City Build and Display Set. <p>LEGO Marvel<p>Launched in April 2012, this sub-theme covers the broader Marvel Comics universe and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). <p>Characters: Key characters include Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Spider-Man, and Wolverine.
