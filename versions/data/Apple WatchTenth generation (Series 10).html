The Apple Watch Series 10 was announced at an Apple's "It's Glowtime" event on September 9, 2024. The device features a thinner design than previous models, measuring 10% thinner than the Series 9. It has the largest display Apple has built for a wearable device, including the Apple Watch Ultra, with up to 30% more screen area. The display allows for an additional line of text, enhancing the visibility of messages, mail, and news.
<p>
Succeeding from the Apple S9, the Apple S10 is the second time utilizing the energy-efficient Sawtooth cores from the A16 Bionic.
<p>
The Series 10 introduces a wider aspect ratio with rounded corners for both the display and case. The display is also 40% brighter when viewed at an angle, improving visibility, and updates once per second in Always On mode, compared to the previous rate of once per minute.
<p>
Apple also introduced a new glossy aluminum finish in jet black, polished using silicon nanoparticles for a specialized surface shine. Other finish options include rose gold and silver aluminum, which are up to 10% lighter than previous models. Additionally, a new titanium finish, which is 20% lighter and carbon-neutral, replaces the stainless steel option from earlier generations.
<p>
The Apple Watch Series 10 retains 50 meters of water resistance and is the fastest-charging Apple Watch to date, reaching 80% battery in 30 minutes. The device features an 18-hour battery life.
<p>
The Apple Watch Series 10 also includes a sleep apnea detector, pending FDA approval, which is also planned to be supported by the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2.
<p>
To enhance phone call quality, the Series 10 incorporates a neural network that suppresses background noise for clearer conversations. The fitness features have been expanded to include tracking for kayakers, canoers, and rowers, along with a Tides app and new depth and water temperature sensors.
<p>
Prior to the announcement of the watchOS 26 at Apple's WWDC 2025, a new feature "wrist flick" gesture (using the wrist to quickly turn over and back to dismiss the incoming notification) will be available on the Apple Watch Series 10 alongside the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.
<p>
Prices for the Apple Watch Series 10 start at $399, with preorders available immediately. The device was released on September 20, 2024.
