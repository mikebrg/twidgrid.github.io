iPad Pro 3rd Generation
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The third generation of iPad Pro is a line of tablet computers developed and marketed by Apple Inc. Two models, with a 12.9 inch or 11 inch screen, were both announced on October 30, 2018, and were available to purchase on November 7. This generation of iPad Pro was the first iPad compatible with the new (second generation) Apple Pencil stylus. Like the second generation, a larger size and stylus compatibility were a point of difference from the rest of Apple's available iPads, but the third generation iPad Pro was also the first iPad to use facial recognition (Face ID) to unlock the device.<p>Upgrades from the second generation iPad Pro include the more powerful A12X Bionic processor, storage capacity up to 1 terabyte and the larger display of the 11 inch model (upgraded from a 10.5 inch model). The third generation iPad Pro also premiered a new design, with a screen that covers more of the front face, and has rounded corners. The 11 inch model is the first generation of that size, and describes itself as such.
