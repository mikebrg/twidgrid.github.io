The "THE LEGO® MOVIE 2™" theme was a line of LEGO sets released in 2019 to coincide with the film The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part, and the product line was retired by the end of 2019. The sets are no longer available for purchase from the official LEGO Shop, but can be found through various third-party and secondary market retailers. <p>Overview<p>The theme featured a variety of sets and characters from the movie, including Emmet, Lucy (Wyldstyle), Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi, and Benny. A key aspect of many sets was the emphasis on creativity and rebuilding, reflecting the movie's message about imaginative play. The theme also introduced Duplo-compatible elements to represent the alien invaders from the film. <p>Notable Sets<p>Welcome to Apocalypseburg! (70840): This large, detailed set reimagined the Statue of Liberty in an apocalypse setting and contained over 3,100 pieces, along with various minifigures. Reviewers highlight the many intricate details and unique room designs, like a coffee shop and a gym made from a train.<p>Emmet's Triple-Decker Couch Mech (70842): An evolution of the iconic double-decker couch from the first film, this set could be built into a couch or a posable mech. It included Emmet, Sweet Mayhem, and Rampage Kitty figures.<p>Queen Watevra's Build Whatever Box (70825): This set focused on the shape-shifting character Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi and included instructions to build 15 different versions, encouraging creative rebuilding.<p>Ultrakatty & Warrior Lucy! (70827): This set featured a fierce, buildable version of Unikitty along with Warrior Lucy minifigures.<p>Benny's Space Squad (70841): A smaller, fan-favorite set, praised for its classic 1980s space aesthetic and inclusion of multiple space-themed minifigures. <p>Availability & Where to Buy<p>Since the theme is retired, the sets are generally not available through standard retail channels. You can find them primarily on online marketplaces:<p>eBay: A common source for both new and used sets, including rare or sealed options like The Rexcelsior (70839) or complete collections of the collectible minifigures.<p>Brickset / Other Collector Sites: Websites dedicated to LEGO sets often have listings for retired sets, and some brick-focused retailers may carry older inventory.<p>Third-party retailers: Some specialized online shops, such as United Brick Co, carry retired sets and individual minifigures from the theme.
