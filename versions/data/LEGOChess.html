The LEGO Chess Video Game (Discontinued)<p>Released in 1998 for Microsoft Windows, LEGO Chess was a strategy game developed by Krisalis Software. <p>Gameplay: The game adhered to the traditional rules of chess but featured humorous, animated cutscenes when a piece was captured, depending on the chosen theme. Players could choose between a Western or Pirates theme in "Story Mode" or mix them in "Quick Match" (though mixing disabled the animations).<p>Tutorial: The game included a comprehensive tutorial mode guided by an "Elvis Presley-esque" voiced King minifigure.<p>Availability: The game is discontinued and no longer officially sold on digital platforms. Physical copies can be found on re-seller sites like eBay, but the game has compatibility issues with modern operating systems and requires fan-made patches to run. <p>Physical LEGO Chess Sets (Current & Discontinued)<p>The LEGO Group has produced numerous physical, brick-built chess sets over the years, many of which are now retired collector's items. <p>Traditional Chess Set (40719)
