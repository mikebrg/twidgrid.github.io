LEGO Trains (2nd generation)
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The "second generation" of LEGO Trains refers to the comprehensive "Grey Era" system introduced in 1980, which became fully available in markets like North America and the UK in 1981. This era is characterized by grey tracks, minifigure compatibility, and an extensive 12-volt (12V) electric system with numerous remote-controlled accessories. <p>Key Features of the 1981 System<p>The 1981 "Grey Era" trains were a significant upgrade over the previous "Blue Era" (1966-1979) system, offering more realism and functionality. <p>Grey Track System: The blue rails and white ties (sleepers) of the previous era were replaced with a more realistic light grey track system that used a new "snap-fit" design for sturdier connections.<p>12-Volt Power: The system was built around a reliable 12V DC power supply delivered via an additional center conductor rail. This allowed for consistent speed control through a transformer and powered many accessories simultaneously. A 4.5V battery-powered option also coexisted.<p>Minifigure Compatibility: Unlike some earlier trains, the 1981 models were perfectly scaled for the newly introduced LEGO minifigures (introduced in 1978), integrating them seamlessly into the broader LEGO Town theme.<p>Enhanced Realism and Functionality: Trains featured a more detailed appearance, including swivel bogies and specialized windows. Many accessories were available for remote control, including:<p>Remote controlled points (switches).<p>Signals (red/green lights).<p>Wagon decoupling points.<p>Level crossings. <p>Notable 1981 Train Sets<p>The 1981 lineup included core train sets and various service packs (accessories): <p>LEGO 7725 Electric Passenger Train Set: A prominent set from the year that could run on both 4.5V (battery) or be upgraded to 12V power using add-on components.<p>LEGO 7862 Remote Controlled Decoupling (accessory pack): This set added the ability to remotely unhitch wagons at specific points on the track.<p>Service Packs: Numerous smaller packs were available to expand the system, such as the LEGO 7861 Lighting Set Electric 12V for illuminating trains and buildings, and various track pieces. <p>This "Grey Era" (1980-1991) is widely regarded by many Adult Fans of LEGO (AFOLs) as a high point in the theme's history due to its rich functionality and detailed system of accessories.
