The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, unveiled on October 18, 2021, and powered by the new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, represented a major redesign. These professional laptops introduced powerful custom Apple Silicon, Liquid Retina XDR displays with ProMotion, and, notably, restored several legacy ports while eliminating the Touch Bar. <p>Key Features and Connectivity<p>M1 Pro and M1 Max Chips: These professional-grade chips delivered significantly higher performance and memory bandwidth than the original M1, with support for more external displays and massive unified memory configurations.<p>Liquid Retina XDR Display: The new displays utilized mini-LED technology for exceptional contrast (1,000,000:1) and brightness (up to 1,600 nits peak), and introduced ProMotion adaptive refresh rate technology (up to 120Hz).<p>Design and The Notch: The aluminum unibody design was new, featuring flatter edges and thinner bezels, which led to the introduction of a camera notch at the top center of the display to house the improved 1080p FaceTime HD camera.<p>Ports (Return of Legacy Ports): In response to professional user demand, Apple reintroduced several ports:<p>MagSafe 3 power port (faster charging)<p>HDMI 2.0 port<p>SDXC card slot<p>Three Thunderbolt 4 ports (USB-C connector)
3.5 mm headphone jack with advanced support for high-impedance headphones.<p>Keyboard: Apple replaced the Touch Bar with a row of full-height physical function keys and maintained the reliable scissor-mechanism "Magic Keyboard" with Touch ID.<p>Audio: Included a high-fidelity six-speaker sound system with force-canceling woofers and studio-quality three-mic array with directional beamforming.
