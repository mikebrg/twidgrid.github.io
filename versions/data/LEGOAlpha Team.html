The LEGO Alpha Team theme was a discontinued action and espionage-themed product line that ran from 2001 to 2002, with a single tie-in video game released in 2000. It centered on an elite team of agents fighting the evil villain Ogel in a variety of environments. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The storyline followed Agent Dash and his team as they battled Ogel, who sought to freeze the world and create a "world in his own image." The theme evolved through different sub-themes: <p>Original Alpha Team (2001): The initial wave focused on missions in diverse environments like urban areas, the desert, and the ocean. Many sets featured a "transforming" action, where a vehicle could change its shape or function, a core play feature of the theme.<p>Mission Deep Sea (2002): The final sub-theme shifted the action underwater to battle Ogel's aquatic forces in his "Orbo Jet" base. <p>Key Characters<p>Agent Dash: The main protagonist and leader of the Alpha Team.<p>Agent Cam, Agent Charge, Agent Tee-Vee, Agent Crunch: Dash's team of highly skilled specialists.<p>Ogel (the villain): An evil mastermind whose name is simply "Lego" spelled backward.<p>Skeleton Drones: Ogel's robotic minions. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>Alpha Team Command Base (Set number: 4794): The largest set of the original theme, featuring the main base of operations.<p>Mobile Command Center (Set number: 4795): A large truck that could transform into a command center and several smaller vehicles.<p>Ogel's Underwater Base (Set number: 4799): The main villain base from the "Mission Deep Sea" sub-theme.<p>Tundra Tracker (Set number: 4781): A vehicle that could split into two smaller crafts. <p>Video Game<p>A single tie-in game titled LEGO Alpha Team was released in late 2000 for the Game Boy Color and Microsoft Windows, ahead of the physical sets' release. The PC version was a 3D puzzle-adventure game where players completed various missions using the team members' unique abilities, while the GBC version was a 2D isometric puzzle game.
