The LEGO Mindstorms NXT 2.0 (set number 8547) was a programmable robotics kit released on August 5, 2009, combining LEGO building with an intelligent brick, motors, and advanced sensors. <p>Key Features and Components<p>The set contained 619 pieces, including a range of sensors and motors for building and programming custom robots. <p>NXT Intelligent Brick: The main component featured a 32-bit microprocessor, a large matrix display, four input and three output ports, a speaker, and support for Bluetooth and USB connectivity.<p>Motors: The set included three interactive servo motors, which provided precise control and also functioned as built-in rotation sensors.<p>Sensors: It came with four sensors:<p>Colour Sensor: A new addition from the first NXT, this sensor distinguished between colors and light settings and could also function as a lamp.<p>Touch Sensors: Two simple button sensors to detect physical contact.<p>Ultrasonic Sensor: Enabled the robot to "see" and measure distance to objects, react to movement, and avoid obstacles. 
Programming and Software<p>The kit came with the intuitive NXT-G 2.0 programming software, an icon-based drag-and-drop environment for both PC and Mac. <p>Ease of Use: The software was designed to be easy for users of all ages to learn, offering 16 fun building and programming challenges.<p>Advanced Options: For experienced programmers, a variety of unofficial languages like NXC and RobotC were also available, and the software from the successor EV3 set could also be used to program the NXT brick. <p>Status and Legacy<p>The LEGO Mindstorms NXT 2.0 set was discontinued at the end of 2012, succeeded by the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 in 2013. Although the set is retired, many of its components, including the sensors and motors, remain compatible with the newer EV3 system, ensuring a degree of backward compatibility for enthusiasts.
