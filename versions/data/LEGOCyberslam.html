LEGO Cyberslam was a discontinued sub-theme of the LEGO Technic line that ran from 1998 until 2001, focusing on competition, action features, and interactive play with a futuristic cybernetic aesthetic. <p>Theme Overview and Features<p>The Cyberslam theme emphasized playable action. Many sets incorporated features like spring-loaded launchers, rubber-tipped projectiles, or shock absorbers to create dynamic functions and simulate combat or competition. The core play mechanic often involved hitting a target on one model to trigger a response in another. <p>The sets were characterized by a color palette including bright blue, purple, and green elements, and often included poseable Technic figures with unique designs. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>The sets in the Cyberslam sub-theme were generally branded as "CyberSlam/Competition" and are now available only through re-sellers. <p>Cyber Strikers (8257): This set included two similar vehicles, one violet and one turquoise, designed to "lurch" forward when a button was pulled back, competing against each other.<p>Cyber Slam Spider (8239): A motorbike with a detachable sidecar and a target drone. The core idea was that hitting the drone's target with a projectile from the bike would cause the drone to fire its own missile. This set also came with a plastic carry case.<p>Robot's Revenge (8245): A robotic vehicle with a built-in "competition cannon" for launching rubber-tipped projectiles.<p>Scorpion Attack (8268): A large, scorpion-like vehicle with a spring-loaded function for attacking.<p>Super Challenge (8266): Another large set designed for competition, including two Technic figures. <p>The innovative, play-focused design of the Cyberslam sets made them a popular part of the Technic line during their run.
