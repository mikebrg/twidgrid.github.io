HD HERO 960 was a reduced-cost version of the HD HERO that shoots at a maximum video resolution of 960p30 and is not compatible with the electronic accessories for the HD HERO because it lacks the proprietary HERO Bus expansion port, although the camera is compatible with all GoPro mounts. It was first listed on August 6, 2010.
