The LEGO Avatar: The Last Airbender theme was a short-lived, discontinued product line from 2006 to 2007 that featured only two sets based on Book One of the animated television show. These sets are no longer available for retail purchase but can be found through re-sellers. <p>Discontinued Sets (2006-2007)<p>Only two official sets were ever released, featuring key characters and locations from the first season of the show. <p>Air Temple (Set number: 3828): This set of 400 pieces included a section of the Northern Air Temple with a sliding door and a catapult, a Fire Nation vehicle, Aang's glider, and minifigures of Aang, Sokka, Momo, a Fire Nation soldier, and a Firebender.<p>Fire Nation Ship (Set number: 3829): This 722-piece set featured Prince Zuko's ship with a built-in catapult, a retractable anchor, and a small dinghy. Minifigures included Aang, Katara, Prince Zuko, a Fire Nation soldier, and a Firebender. <p>LEGO Ideas and Custom Options<p>Due to the show's lasting popularity, fans have created numerous projects on the LEGO Ideas platform, some of which have reached the 10,000-vote threshold for official review, though none have been approved for production as of yet. <p>For those looking for current options, unofficial custom-designed minifigures are available from various third-party retailers that print onto genuine LEGO parts. Additionally, the characters Aang, Katara, Sokka, Zuko, Toph, and Korra are available as LEGO-style characters within the Lego Fortnite game. <p>Note that the currently available "LEGO Avatar" theme is a separate product line based on the James Cameron Avatar films, which have no relation to the animated series.
