" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
LEGO produced a successful line of 12-volt (12V) train sets from 1969 to 1991, known for their realistic designs and system of remote-controlled accessories. These sets used a central conducting rail to power the trains via a transformer. <p>Notable 12V Train Sets (Grey Era: 1980-1991) <p>The most extensive and popular 12V train sets were part of the "Grey Era" introduced in 1980, which were designed to scale with minifigures and integrated well with the LEGO Town theme. <p>LEGO 7740 Electric Inter-City Passenger Train Set: A large, detailed passenger train released in 1980, known for its sleek design and numerous minifigures.<p>LEGO 7750 Electric Steam Locomotive: A highly sought-after set from 1980 featuring large, unique driving wheels and a detailed engine design.<p>LEGO 7745 High-Speed City Express Passenger Train: Released in 1985, this set was a modern, high-speed train model of its time.<p>LEGO 7735 Freight Train Set: A comprehensive cargo train set from 1985 that included several types of wagons for diverse play scenarios.<p>LEGO 7760 Diesel Shunter Locomotive: A smaller, more versatile diesel shunting locomotive released in 1980.<p>LEGO 7725 Electric Passenger Train Set: A smaller, entry-level passenger train set released in 1981, offering an accessible entry point to the 12V system. <p>Overview of the 12V System
The 12V system was highly regarded for its functionality and upgrade potential. <p>Power Source: Power was delivered to the train motor through metal strips on the grey tracks, connected to a mains transformer and speed controller.<p>Accessories: Unlike the simpler 4.5V battery system, the 12V line included a wide range of remotely controlled accessories, such as signals, points (switches), level crossings, and automatic decoupling points for wagons.<p>Compatibility: All train sets from this era used the same gauge track, and basic 4.5V (battery) models could be upgraded to 12V by adding a 12V motor, transformer, and conducting rails.<p>Collectibility: The 12V sets are now vintage, retired products and are popular collector items, primarily available through third-party marketplaces.
