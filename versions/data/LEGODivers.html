LEGO has produced several themes involving divers, starting with the discontinued "Divers" theme from 1997-1998, and continuing with modern sets under the "LEGO City" banner that focus on deep-sea exploration. <p>Original LEGO "Divers" Theme (Discontinued)<p>The original "Divers" was a sub-theme of the LEGO Town series released in 1997 (and sold through 1998). It focused on realistic, present-day maritime exploration and treasure hunting. <p>Focus: Unlike the more futuristic Aquazone theme, these sets featured real-world equipment, surface ships, mini-submarines, and various sea life, including many unique and rare animal molds.<p>Notable Sets:<p>Diving Expedition Explorer (6560): The largest set, featuring a large surface ship, a mini-sub, and multiple minifigures.<p>Deep Reef Refuge (6441): Included an underwater research station and a large submarine with robot arms.<p>Shark Attack (6599): A smaller set featuring a diver and a shark. <p>Modern LEGO City "Deep Sea Explorers"<p>The diving concept was revived in 2015 and continues as a sub-theme of the current LEGO City line, often under the name "Deep Sea Explorers" or "Jungle Explorers" (when exploring rivers and coastlines). These sets are widely available and feature updated designs and new animal figures. <p>Focus: Modern sets continue the focus on exploration and discovery, often featuring new submarine designs, inflatable boats, coral reef settings, and new sea creatures like manta rays and hammerhead sharks.<p>Notable Sets:<p>Deep-Sea Explorer Submarine (60379): Features a large submarine with a mech-style diving suit and a shipwreck with circling sharks protecting sunken treasure.<p>Diving Yacht (60221): A large leisure yacht with a sun deck, a sea floor scene with a treasure chest, and diver minifigures.<p>Explorer Diving Boat (60377): Includes an inflatable boat, mini-sub, and various sea life figures. <p>Other Related Themes<p>Other themes have also explored underwater concepts:<p>Aquazone (1995-1999): A futuristic theme where different factions battled for crystals.<p>Aqua Raiders (2007): A standalone, discontinued theme that combined aspects of the realistic "Divers" and futuristic "Aquazone" themes, focused on treasure hunting in the Bermuda Triangle.<p>Atlantis (2010-2011): A theme where divers searched for the lost city of Atlantis and fought sea monsters.
