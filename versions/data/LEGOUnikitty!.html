The LEGO Unikitty! theme was a line of sets released in 2018 based on the animated television series of the same name, which was a spin-off of The LEGO Movie. The theme has since been retired, with production ending by late 2019. <p>Overview<p>The sets centered on Princess Unikitty and her friends in the Unikingdom. Unlike standard minifigure-based themes, the sets featured brick-built figures with limited articulation but vibrant colors and playful designs.
