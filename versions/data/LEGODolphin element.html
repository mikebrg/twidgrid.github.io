The LEGO dolphin element is a pre-molded animal figure that has appeared in various sets across different themes. There have been several distinct molds and colors over the years, with the most recent version widely available in current sets. <p>Types of LEGO Dolphin Elements<p>LEGO has produced three main molds for the dolphin element: <p>Classic System Dolphin (1995-1999): The original mold was used in themes like Town, Paradisa, and Aquazone. It appeared in light gray, white, and transparent-light blue colors. This version is now discontinued and available only from re-sellers.<p>Friends Dolphin (2013 onwards): A new mold was created for the LEGO Friends theme, featuring a small hole on top to accommodate accessories. This version has appeared in various colors including bright light blue, sand blue, and medium lavender.<p>System Relaunch Dolphin (2017 onwards): A newer system-compatible mold was introduced in 2017, which looks very similar to the original but has a different connection point at the bottom (an axle holder) and has appeared in colors like light bluish gray and medium blue.<p>Current Availability and Sets<p>The dolphin element is currently available in multiple active LEGO themes, including a popular brick-built version in the Creator 3-in-1 line. <p>LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Dolphin and Turtle (31128): This set does not use a single molded dolphin piece, but rather is a brick-built model of a dolphin and a turtle using standard LEGO bricks. It is widely available for purchase from the Official LEGO Shop and other retailers.<p>LEGO Friends Sets: The Friends line frequently features dolphin rescue missions and other beach/ocean-themed sets that include the Friends dolphin figure.<p>LEGO City Sets: The modern system dolphin mold appears in various LEGO City sets, particularly in the "Fun at the Beach" series or other ocean exploration sets.<p>Bricks & Pieces / Re-sellers: You can purchase specific dolphin molds and colors from third-party marketplaces like BrickLink and BrickOwl, or sometimes through the official LEGO "Pick a Brick" service if the part is in current production.
