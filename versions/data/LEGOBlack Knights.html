The LEGO Black Knights was a popular, discontinued theme that was the primary LEGO Castle line from 1992 to 1994. It centered on a war between two main factions: the Black Knights (also known as the Black Dragons) and the benevolent Lion Knights (the Crusaders).<p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The Black Knights theme was known for introducing new castle elements and a more detailed aesthetic than previous themes. It depicted an ongoing struggle between the two main factions for control of the kingdom.<p>Factions: The "Black Knights" were the antagonists in this story, identifiable by their black, yellow, and red color scheme and a prominent dragon/wyvern crest.
