The LEGO Kingdoms theme was a classic, medieval fantasy-themed product line that ran from 2010 to 2012. It was largely seen as a successor to the highly popular LEGO Castle line and focused on a war between two rival factions: the benevolent Lion Knights and the villainous Dragon Knights. <p>Overview<p>The theme returned to the roots of LEGO Castle play, prioritizing classic knights, castles, siege weapons, and a medieval setting over the magic and fantasy elements (such as wizards and skeletons) of earlier themes like LEGO Fantasy Era. The focus was purely on the conflict between the two human factions. <p>Factions:<p>Lion Knights: The "heroes" of the story, identifiable by their blue and red color scheme and a lion emblem. They defended their castles and sought to protect the kingdom.
Dragon Knights: The "villains," known for their red and black colors and a dragon emblem. They utilized heavy weaponry like ballistas and catapults to attack Lion Knight strongholds.<p>Role-Play: The sets were designed to encourage imaginative medieval role-play, with functions like working catapults, drawbridges, and 'exploding' walls. <p>Construction Sets<p>A total of 17 main sets and several promotional polybags were released during the theme's two-year run.<p>King's Castle (7946): A key set from the first wave, it was the main stronghold for the Lion Knights and included numerous minifigures, a royal throne, and a portcullis.<p>Dragon Knights Battle Pack (853173): A popular set for "army building," allowing fans to quickly gather a force of Dragon Knight soldiers and weapons.<p>Prison Tower Rescue (7947): A smaller, action-oriented set where the Lion Knights rescue a princess from a Dragon Knight tower.<p>Outpost Attack (7948): A set featuring a small Lion Knight outpost being attacked by a Dragon Knight on a horse.<p>King's Carriage Ambush (7188): Featured a royal carriage being attacked by Dragon Knights, including a hidden cannon feature.<p>Blacksmith Attack (6918): A smaller set featuring a blacksmith's shop under attack. <p>Legacy and Status<p>The LEGO Kingdoms theme was discontinued by the end of 2012 and was succeeded by LEGO Castle in 2013, which brought back some of the fantasy elements that were missing from Kingdoms. The sets from the Kingdoms theme are now retired and are considered collector's items. They are available on secondary marketplaces like eBay and BrickLink, and are often sought after by fans who enjoy the classic, authentic medieval aesthetic.
