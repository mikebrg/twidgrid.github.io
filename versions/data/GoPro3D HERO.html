GoPro released the 3D HERO system in April 2011, which coupled two HD HERO cameras via a synchronization cable in a single housing to form a stereoscopic 3D camera. One of the cameras is used in upside-down mode. The 3D HERO system is also compatible with the HD HERO2. The synchronized videos are processed using GoPro CineForm software and exported as an anaglyph to be viewed wearing red-cyan glasses.
