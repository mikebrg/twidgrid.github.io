The LEGO 4 Juniors theme was a short-lived product line available from 2003 to 2004, designed as a simplified bridge between the larger DUPLO bricks and the standard, more complex LEGO System bricks. <p>Theme Overview<p>The 4 Juniors theme aimed to provide a building experience suitable for children around the age of four (hence the name "4 Juniors"), offering larger, pre-built or simple-to-assemble parts. The sets often used bigger pieces that were easier for little hands to handle, with some pieces that were incompatible with the main LEGO System bricks. <p>Sub-themes and Sets<p>The line was divided into several sub-themes based on popular licensed properties and general themes. <p>SpongeBob SquarePants (2004): This was the first iteration of the LEGO SpongeBob theme.<p>Bikini Bottom Express (Set number: 10108)<p>Mr. Krabs Crab Shack (Set number: 10109)<p>Dinosaur (2004): Based loosely on the Dino Attack concept, these sets were simpler and more focused on capturing dinosaurs with basic vehicles.<p>Dino Explorer (Set number: 7000)
Dino Observation Post (Set number: 7002)<p>Knights' Kingdom (2004): A simpler, non-story-based castle theme that preceded the more complex Knights' Kingdom II.<p>King's Castle (Set number: 4805)<p>Dragon Base (Set number: 4806)<p>Pirates (2004): A return to the classic Pirates theme with simplified designs.<p>Pirate's Ship (Set number: 7001)<p>Spider-Man 2 (2004): Tie-in sets for the Spider-Man 2 film.<p>Doc Ock's Crime Spree (Set number: 4858)<p>Doc Ock's Cafe Attack (Set number: 4854)<p>City (2003): General city and emergency service sets.<p>Fire Station (Set number: 6000)<p>Police Station (Set number: 6002) <p>Discontinuation and Successor<p>The theme was discontinued in 2004, and the concept of a "bridge" between DUPLO and standard LEGO was later revisited with the current LEGO Juniors theme (now part of the LEGO 4+ line within the main themes), which successfully uses standard LEGO pieces in simpler build instructions to help children transition.
