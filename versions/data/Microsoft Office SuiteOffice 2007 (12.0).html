The Mac OS X equivalent, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, was released on January 15, 2008.<p>Office 2007 introduced a new graphical user interface called the Fluent User Interface, which uses ribbons and an Office menu instead of menu bars and toolbars.

The new formats are intended to facilitate the sharing of information between programs, improve security, reduce the size of documents, and enable new recovery scenarios.<p>Office 2007 is compatible with Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 through Windows 10 v1607 and Windows Server 2016. It is the last version of Microsoft Office to support Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows Vista RTM.<p>Office 2007 includes new applications and server-side tools, including Microsoft Office Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses, which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005.

Its designer-oriented counterpart, Microsoft Expression Web, is targeted for general web development. However, neither application has been included in Office 2007 software suites.<p>Speech recognition functionality has been removed from the individual programs in the Office 2007 suite. Users must install a previous version of Office to use speech recognition features.<p>According to Forrester Research, as of May 2010, Microsoft Office 2007 is used in 81% of enterprises it surveyed (its sample comprising 115 North American and European enterprise and SMB decision makers).<p>Support for Office 2007 ended on October 10, 2017. On August 27, 2021, Microsoft announced that Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 would be cut off from connecting to Microsoft 365 Exchange servers on November 1, 2021.<p>Development<p>Microsoft announced Beta 1 of Office 2007 with the reveal of the ribbon user interface on March 9, 2006, at CeBIT in Germany.<p>Beta 2 was announced by Bill Gates at WinHEC 2006, and was initially released to the public at no cost from Microsoft's web site. However, because of an unprecedented number of downloads, a fee of $1.50 was introduced for each product downloaded after August 2, 2006, The beta was updated on September 14, 2006, in Beta 2 Technical Refresh (Beta2TR).
