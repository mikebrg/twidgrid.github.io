LEGO DUPLO Zoo refers to both a range of discontinued sets released over several years and the numerous current DUPLO sets that feature animal and safari themes. These sets are designed for toddlers aged 1.5-5 years, focusing on imaginative play and skill development. 
Current Animal-Themed DUPLO Sets<p>While a dedicated "Zoo" theme is not a current, ongoing product line, The LEGO Group frequently releases sets featuring animals and exploration under the DUPLO Town and Wild Animals sub-themes.<p>Wild Animals of the World (10975): This large set includes 22 animals and covers all seven continents, with a focus on different environments like the African savannah, a forest river, and Antarctica. It is designed to introduce toddlers to global wildlife and ecosystems.<p>Jungle Explorer Helicopter at Base Camp (60437): While part of the LEGO City theme, a DUPLO-compatible animal set is available to explore the jungle with animal figures.<p>Wild Animals of Asia (10974): This set focuses on Asian wildlife, featuring a buildable environment with pandas, elephants, and monkeys. <p>Discontinued "Zoo" Sets<p>Over the years, The LEGO Group has released numerous specific "Zoo" sets that are now retired and only available on the secondary market. These sets are popular collector's items. <p>Big City Zoo (6157): A popular set released in 2012 that included a large variety of animals (14 in total), enclosures, a penguin playground, and a zoo vehicle.<p>My First Zoo (6136): A simpler 2012 set that included a tiger, elephant, giraffe, polar bear, and a zookeeper figure.<p>Baby Zoo (4962): A 2006 set focusing on young animals like a lion cub, giraffe, polar bear, and elephant, designed to teach nurturing and care.<p>Zoo Van (2661): A vintage set from 1990 that included an animal transporter and a zookeeper figure. <p>Availability<p>Current Sets: Modern, animal-themed sets can be purchased from the official Official LEGO Shop and major retailers like Walmart and Amazon.<p>Discontinued Sets: Retired sets and individual animal figures are available from online marketplaces such as eBay and BrickLink.
