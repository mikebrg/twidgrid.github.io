The LEGO Time Cruisers was a short-lived, discontinued product line from 1996 to 1998. The theme centered on a team of "good guy" scientists traveling through time to stop villains who were trying to alter history. The sets were characterized by their mix-and-match appearance, as they combined elements from various LEGO historical and modern themes.<p>Theme Overview and Story<p>The storyline was detailed in accompanying comics and instruction booklets. A primary component of the sets was a "time machine" powered by cylinders filled with artifacts (the "time crystals"). The heroes, led by Dr. Cyber, built vehicles from spare parts and traveled through different LEGO worlds (like Pirates, Castle, Western, and Space) to stop the evil Time Twisters (the antagonist sub-theme from 1997) from stealing historical artifacts. <p>Key Characters<p>Dr. Cyber: The main protagonist and brilliant scientist who led the mission to repair the timeline.<p>Tony Twister & Professor Millennium: The twin antagonists and leaders of the Time Twisters who sought to steal the artifacts.<p>Goldie and Boney: A ghost and a skeleton figure, respectively, who served the villains.<p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>The sets are now collector's items and can only be found on the secondary market. <p>Time Cruisers HQ (Set number: 6494): The main base of operations for the heroes, which featured a large, clock-themed building and a time machine vehicle.<p>Hypno Cruiser (Set number: 6493): A unique ship with a spinning "hypno" disc feature on the front.<p>Hovercraft Hideout (Set number: 6491): A set featuring a hovercraft and a small island hideout.<p>Twisted Time Train (Set number: 6497): While part of the "Time Twisters" sub-theme, this was a large, popular set that was a bizarre mix of a steam locomotive and various other elements. <p>Legacy and Related Themes<p>The Time Cruisers theme was an experimental line that was notable for its cross-theme compatibility and unique approach to storytelling. While the theme was discontinued in 1998, the concept of time travel and historical settings continues in other LEGO properties, and the sets themselves remain a unique piece of LEGO history.
