LEGO World City was the name for the main LEGO town-themed product line for a brief period from 2003 to 2004, serving as a transitional theme between the earlier "LEGO Town" and the modern, ongoing "LEGO City" theme. The sets focused primarily on police, fire, coast guard, and train services. <p>Theme Overview<p>World City sets centered on rescue services and transportation, with less emphasis on general civilian life and buildings compared to the themes that came before and after it. The sets from this period are now discontinued but can be acquired through re-sellers. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>The theme included a variety of sets, notably a number of electric train sets that used the 9V system (a discontinued LEGO train technology). <p>Police HQ (Set number: 7035): A central police station for the theme.<p>Coast Watch HQ (Set number: 7047): The main base for the coast guard sub-theme.<p>High Speed Train (Set number: 4511): One of the main 9V electric train sets, featuring a bullet-style locomotive.<p>Cargo Train (Set number: 4512): A 9V freight train set that included a locomotive and cargo wagons.<p>Grand Central Station (Set number: 4513): A station set for the train system.<p>Fire Command Craft (Set number: 7046): A large fire boat for water-based rescue missions.<p>Armoured Car Action (Set number: 7033): A set featuring a secure transport vehicle. <p>Successor: LEGO City<p>The World City brand was retired in 2005 and succeeded by the current and highly successful LEGO City theme. Modern LEGO City sets, including new trains, use the different "Powered Up" technology, which is Bluetooth-enabled and not directly compatible with the older 9V system without modifications.
