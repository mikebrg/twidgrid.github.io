The LEGO Vidiyo theme has been discontinued. Originally launched in collaboration with Universal Music Group in March 2021, the product line featured physical sets and an augmented reality (AR) app that allowed children to create music videos. However, the theme was canceled less than a year later, by the end of January 2022, and the accompanying app was shut down in January 2024. <p>Because the line is no longer in production, your best options for finding these sets are through secondary marketplaces or resellers. The sets were mainly centered around collectibles, like minifigures called Bandmates and special effect tiles called BeatBits. <p>Collectible sets and figures<p>BeatBoxes: These were small, collectible cubes that came with a unique minifigure and special-effect BeatBits tiles.<p>Bandmates (43101 & 43108): These were mystery boxes containing one of 12 unique, music-themed minifigures, such as a Werewolf Drummer, Genie Dancer, and DJ Cheetah.<p>BeatBits: These were 2x2 printed tiles that unlocked special effects in the app. <p>Larger stage sets<p>LEGO Vidiyo K-Pawp Concert (43113): A 514-piece set to inspire music videos.<p>LEGO Vidiyo The Boombox (43115): A larger set that functioned as a stage, including four minifigures and 18 BeatBits.<p>LEGO Vidiyo Candy Castle Stage (43111): This set provided a colorful, sweet-themed stage for music videos.<p>LEGO Vidiyo Party Llama Beatbox (43105): A smaller set featuring the Party Llama minifigure, who is also known as the official artist L.L.A.M.A..
