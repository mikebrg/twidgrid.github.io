Amazon Kindle Scribe (2024 release)
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The 2024 release of the Kindle Scribe includes a redesigned front face with white bezels, a new color-matching Premium stylus pen with a soft rubber eraser, and otherwise retains the hardware and feature specifications of the original Scribe. The base 16 GB Scribe now includes the Premium stylus pen, and has a corresponding price increase. The Basic stylus pen was not updated for the new models and is not available to be bundled with them. The Scribe is available in Metallic Jade and Tungsten body colors that carry over to the ledger on the front. Amazon considers this model to still be in the first generation of Scribe, as a 2024 release. It was released on December 4, 2024.<p>Amazon announced several software features of the new Scribe, which were also to be later added to the original Scribe via firmware updates. They include the ability to write directly on reflowable e-books with Active Canvas, where book text will reflow around a resizeable box containing handwriting, and a new side panel called Extended Margin, where handwriting can be scrolled and can be hidden or popped out. New Notebook features include refining handwriting into a new script typeface and LLM genAI-powered summaries of refined notebooks.<p>On December 4, 2024, firmware 5.17.2 was made available for the Kindle Scribe 2022 release. It includes the Active Canvas, highlight enhancements, and AI Notebook Tools that were shown during the debut announcement of the 2024 release. This coincides with the official public availability of the 2024 release hardware. The Extended Margin feature was not available until the firmware 5.17.3 release, on February 5.
