The Digital HERO5 was first introduced in 2008. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 m of depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 in × 1.75 in × 1.25 in (66 mm × 44 mm × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.<p>The DH5 was marketed with a basic camera and housing as the Wrist HERO, or bundled with accessories as the Motorsports HERO.
