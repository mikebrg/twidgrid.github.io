The LEGO Forestmen was a popular, discontinued sub-theme within the LEGO Castle line that ran from 1987 to 1990, with a few sets available until 1992. It featured a band of medieval outlaws in the vein of Robin Hood, operating from secret forest hideouts and challenging the authority of the classic Lion Knights. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The Forestmen were portrayed as heroes of the common people, taking from the rich (often the Lion Knights) and giving to the poor. They were a peaceful faction that primarily lived in harmony with nature and built villages in trees and integrated with rock formations. <p>Aesthetic: The sets featured a rustic color scheme of brown, green, and gray, focusing on natural hideouts rather than traditional castles. The minifigures had unique outfits and headwear, often with feathers, giving them a distinct and beloved look.<p>Unique Feature: The use of large, specialized tree and rock pieces was innovative for the time and made their hideouts look more organic and integrated with the environment.<p>Factions: The primary faction was the Forestmen themselves. They were often portrayed as rivals to the main ruling powers of the era, such as the Lion Knights and later, the Dragon Masters. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are now highly sought-after collector's items and are only available on the secondary market from re-sellers. <p>Forestmen's River Fortress (Set number: 6077): The flagship set and primary hideout, featuring a large fortress built on a raised rock baseplate with a functional drawbridge and a raft.<p>Forestmen's Crossing (Set number: 6071): A medium-sized set with a covered bridge and a guard post that could be built in several configurations.<p>Forestmen's Hideout (Set number: 6066): A popular hideout built into a large tree with a hidden staircase.<p>Forestmen's ambush (Set number: 6054): A small set featuring a tree with a hidden opening for an ambush.<p>Camouflaged Outpost (Set number: 6017): A small set featuring a hidden lookout post. <p>Legacy and Related Themes<p>The Forestmen theme remains a fan favorite and is widely considered one of the classic LEGO themes. The concept of forest outlaws has appeared in other forms over the years: <p>Wolfpack (1992-1993): A later, more rugged and less benevolent forest-based faction.<p>Dark Forest (1996): A darker, more villainous forest-based theme.<p>LEGO Icons Lion Knights' Castle (10305): The modern adult collector's castle includes an homage to the classic Forestmen faction, with a small hideout area in the back and a minifigure with the classic torso design, a nod to the enduring popularity of this iconic theme.
