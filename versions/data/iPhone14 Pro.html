The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth generation flagship iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max. The devices were unveiled alongside the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 7, 2022, and were made available on September 16, 2022.<p>The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max were the first iPhones to have a new type of display cutout called "Dynamic Island", replacing the notch design that has been in use since the iPhone X was introduced. Along with the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro models add bidirectional satellite connectivity to contact emergency services when out of range of Wi-Fi and cellular networks.<p>Along with the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus, these were the last iPhones to use a Lightning port; the iPhone 14 Pro models were discontinued in September 2023, and their successors, the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, replaced the Lightning port with USB-C. iPhone 14 Pro models (as well as the iPhone 14 models) sold in the United States dropped support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to lack a discrete SIM card reader.
