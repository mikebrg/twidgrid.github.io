The term "LEGO Castle series" refers to the entire range of products under the official LEGO Castle theme, which has a rich history spanning over four decades. While a continuous, dedicated "Castle" theme is not currently in production, several individual, highly detailed sets are available as modern homages. <p>History of the LEGO Castle Theme (1978-Present)<p>The Castle theme was one of the original three LEGOLAND themes and has evolved significantly, featuring numerous sub-themes and factions: <p>Classic Castle Era (1978-1983): Launched with the iconic yellow castle and simple knights.<p>"Factions Era" (1984-1997): Introduced distinct, color-coded factions that battled each other, a popular period for many fans:<p>Lion Knights/Crusaders: The "good guys" with a red and yellow lion crest.<p>Black Falcons: The rival faction with a black and white falcon crest.<p>Forestmen & Wolfpack: Outlaws and bandits living in the woods.<p>Dragon Masters & Fright Knights: Themes introducing dragons, wizards, and a darker, more gothic aesthetic.<p>Fantasy Eras (2000s): Themes like Knights' Kingdom II and the 2007 Castle theme introduced fantasy elements such as skeletons, trolls, and orcs.<p>Kingdoms (2010-2012): A return to a more realistic medieval setting with a war between the Lion Kingdom and Dragon Kingdom.
