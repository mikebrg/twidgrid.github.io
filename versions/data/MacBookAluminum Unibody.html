" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The aluminum unibody MacBook, released on October 14, 2008, introduced a significant design overhaul, featuring an enclosure precision-machined from a single block of aluminum for enhanced durability. This model also debuted an innovative buttonless, all-glass multi-touch trackpad and an LED-backlit display with edge-to-edge glass. <p>Key Features and Ports<p>Unibody Enclosure: The primary innovation was the single-piece aluminum case, which offered superior strength and a thinner profile compared to the previous polycarbonate MacBooks.<p>Glass Multi-Touch Trackpad: A large, all-glass trackpad that doubled as a button and supported new four-finger gestures for tasks like activating Exposé or switching applications.<p>LED-Backlit Display: The 13.3-inch display featured LED backlighting and a seamless, edge-to-edge glass design.<p>Ports: Connectivity options included two USB 2.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, audio in/out ports, and a Kensington lock slot.<p>Missing Features: This model notably removed the FireWire 400 port that was present in previous MacBooks, a point of disappointment for users who relied on the feature for data transfer or Target Disk Mode. It also used a new Mini DisplayPort for video output, requiring separate adapters for DVI or VGA connections.<p>Backlit Keyboard: The higher-end 2.4 GHz configuration included a backlit keyboard, a feature absent from the base 2.0 GHz model.
