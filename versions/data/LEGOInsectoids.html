The LEGO Insectoids theme was a discontinued LEGO Space sub-theme that ran from 1998 to 1999. It focused on an alien race called the Zotaxians who disguised their vehicles as giant insects to harvest energy on a new planet. <p>Theme Overview and Story<p>The storyline described the Zotaxians crash-landing on the barren planet Holox and discovering an inner world with an energy source that powered the eggs of native giant insects called "Bilgin Bugs". The Zotaxians created artificial, transparent neon-green "Voltstones" to absorb this energy and disguised their vehicles as mechanical insects to collect them. A conflict ensued when the native bugs realized the Zotaxians were stealing their vital energy. <p>The sets were known for bringing back several popular classic Space elements:<p>Transparent Neon-Green Parts: A signature color for the Voltstones and vehicle details.<p>Magnets: Many vehicles used magnets to pick up the Voltstones.<p>Light and Sound: Several sets included a unique electronic brick with three buttons for different sounds and a light-up section. 
Notable Discontinued Sets<p>The theme included 15 sets in total, primarily released in 1998. <p>Arachnoid Star Base (Set number: 6977): The largest set, it was a mobile base featuring a large rover design and a central command area.<p>Celestial Stinger (Set number: 6969): A large spacecraft with detachable mini-flyers, used to transport captured Voltstones.<p>Planetary Prowler (Set number: 6919): A substantial ground vehicle for exploration and harvesting, with a crane feature.<p>Bi-Wing Blaster (Set number: 6905): A popular, smaller set featuring an insect-like flying vehicle.<p>Cosmic Creeper (Set number: 6837) and Beta Buzzer (Set number: 6817): Smaller, affordable sets that featured basic insectoid vehicles and minifigures. <p>Related Themes and Modern Options<p>UFO (1997-1999): The immediate predecessor in the Space line, featuring a related alien storyline.<p>Galaxy Squad (2013): A later space theme that also featured humans battling insect-like aliens.<p>LEGO Ideas The Insect Collection (21342): For those interested in insects, this modern set offers detailed, life-size, brick-built models of a blue morpho butterfly, Hercules beetle, and Chinese mantis for display, though it is not part of a narrative space theme.
