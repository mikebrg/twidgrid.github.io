The LEGO Space theme launched in 1978 as one of the first three official play themes, offering sets based on a science-fiction future of exploration and colonization. The initial sets were characterized by a color scheme of grey and blue with transparent green or yellow windows, and featured the new minifigure astronauts. <p>Key Elements of the 1978 Theme<p>The 1978 sets were a significant design leap for LEGO, introducing new specialized parts and building techniques that allowed for smoother, more detailed vehicles and bases. <p>Minifigures: The theme introduced the iconic "Classic Spacemen" minifigures, wearing red or white spacesuits with simple, smiling faces. They featured helmets without visors, air tanks on their backs, and C-shaped hands to hold accessories.<p>Color Scheme: The predominant colors were grey for ground vehicles and blue with transparent yellow windows for spaceships.<p>Design: Early designs were utilitarian and simplistic, focused on function over detail, often featuring basic wheeled vehicles and ships controlled by steering wheels, reflecting inspiration from 1960s and 1970s real-world space technology.<p>Parts: The sets incorporated new pieces like transparent yellow windows, radar dishes, and antennas, which were key to the space aesthetic. <p>Notable 1978 Space Sets<p>The first year of the LEGO Space theme introduced several foundational sets that are now considered classics. <p>LEGO 493 Space Command Center (or 926 Command Centre in non-US markets): One of the larger base sets of the initial release, featuring multiple sections and four minifigures (two red, two white).<p>LEGO 487 Space Cruiser (or 924 Transporter in non-US markets): A key spaceship set that included a small ground vehicle and two minifigures.<p>LEGO 918 Space Transport: A smaller spaceship set that came with one red astronaut minifigure.<p>LEGO 462 Rocket Launcher (or 897 Launcher in non-US markets): A smaller vehicle set, featuring a ground vehicle with a rocket, and two minifigures.<p>LEGO 885 Space Scooter: A small, simple scooter set with one red astronaut minifigure.
