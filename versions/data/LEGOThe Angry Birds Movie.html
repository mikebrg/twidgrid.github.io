The LEGO The Angry Birds Movie theme was a licensed product line of six construction sets released in April 2016 based on the animated film. The line utilized special, larger minifigure molds for the birds and was discontinued by the end of 2017. <p>Set Overview<p>The six sets in the theme were designed to recreate scenes and characters from the movie, incorporating catapults so builders could launch the birds at the pigs' structures, much like in the original video games. <p>75821, Piggy Car Escape, 74 pieces - Chuck, Piggy<p>75822, Piggy Plane Attack, 168 pieces - Red, Pilot Pig<p>75823, Bird Island Egg Heist, 277 pieces - Red, Matilda, Biker Pig<p>75824, Pig City Teardown, 386 pieces - Red, Stella, 2 Piggies<p>75825, Piggy Pirate Ship, 620 pieces - Red, Bomb, Pirate Pig, Leonard<p>75826, King Pig's Castle, 859 pieces - Red, Mighty Eagle, King Pig (Leonard), Chef Pig, Foreman Pig<p>Key Characters and Features<p>Unique Minifigures: Instead of traditional LEGO minifigures, the birds (Red, Chuck, Bomb, Matilda, Stella, Mighty Eagle) were represented by specialized, slightly larger, molded figures to match their cartoonish designs in the film. The pig characters used more standard minifigure designs with unique head molds and expressions.<p>"Deconstruction" Play: A core aspect of the sets was replicating the gameplay of the Angry Birds video game. Each set included at least one catapult for launching the birds to hit target zones, which in turn collapsed the pig's structures and vehicles.<p>Digital Integration: The physical sets tied into the Angry Birds Action! mobile app, allowing users to scan "Nexo Power" style shields or elements within the sets to unlock in-game content.
