The Canon EOS M5 is a digital mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera announced by Canon on September 15, 2016, and released in November 2016.
<p>
As with all of the Canon EOS M series cameras, the M5 uses the Canon EF-M lens mount. With the EF-EOS M adapter, any other Canon EF lens mount or Canon EF-S lens mount lens can be used.
<p>
The M5 is the first M series camera with an integrated electronic viewfinder. The screen is tiltable and can be articulated downwards, so that a vlogger can see themselves in the screen.
