The LEGO RoboForce theme was a short-lived, discontinued LEGO Space sub-theme released exclusively in the United States in 1997. It featured a team of astronauts in large, robotic vehicles battling the alien UFO faction. <p>Theme Overview and Story<p>RoboForce was positioned as the "good guy" faction in the 1997 Space themes, fighting against the cybernetic aliens from the UFO line. The minifigures, including the character Chip Nebula, piloted large mecha-style robots that were either humanoid (Orange Class) or animal-shaped (Green Class). <p>The "Robos" were powered by "Robo Disks," which were rectangular power sources that added a collectible element to the theme. The sets were noted for their distinct orange, green, and black color schemes, and some of the robot "heads" could detach to become smaller spacecraft or escape pods. <p>Discontinued Sets<p>Only four sets were produced under the RoboForce sub-theme, making them relatively rare and sought-after by collectors. They are no longer available from official retailers and can only be found on the secondary market. <p>Robo Master (Set number: 2154): The largest set in the theme, part of the Green Class, which included a small starcraft reminiscent of the Unitron Star Hawk II as a tribute.<p>Robo Stalker (Set number: 2153): A large Orange Class humanoid robot that featured a police-like patrol function and buzz saws for rescue or capture.<p>Robo Raptor (Set number: 2152): A Green Class animal-shaped robot, unique for being the only set in the line not to feature a space craft as its "head".<p>Robo Raider (Set number: 2151): The smallest and least expensive set, an Orange Class robot with a more basic design and one minifigure. <p>Legacy<p>The concept of human-piloted mecha in the RoboForce theme was revisited in the later, more detailed, and story-driven LEGO Exo-Force theme, which launched in 2006.
