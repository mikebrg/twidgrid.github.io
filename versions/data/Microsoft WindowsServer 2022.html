Windows Server 2022 is the thirteenth major version of the Windows NT operating system produced by Microsoft to be released under the Windows Server brand name. It was announced at Microsoft's Ignite event from March 2–4, 2021. It was released on August 18, 2021, almost 3 years after Windows Server 2019, and a few months before the Windows 11 operating system.<p>Windows Server 2022 is based on the "Iron" codebase, unlike Windows 10 21H2, which is based on the "Vibranium" codebase like its predecessor 20H2; this renders the updates between Windows 10 21H2 and Windows Server 2022 incompatible. Like its predecessor, Windows Server 2019, it requires x64 processors.<p>It was succeeded by Windows Server 2025 on November 1, 2024.<p>History<p>Microsoft announced Windows Server 2022 on February 22, 2021, scheduled for March 2. On March 3, Microsoft started distributing preview builds on Windows Update. Windows Server 2022 reached general availability on August 18, 2021.
