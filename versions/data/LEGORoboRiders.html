The LEGO RoboRiders theme was a short-lived, discontinued product line from 2000 to 2001. It was a spin-off of the earlier LEGO Throwbots (or Slizers) line and focused on a conflict between mechanical "riders" and a giant lava monster in a post-apocalyptic world. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The story took place on Planet X, a world devastated by an environmental disaster. The main characters, the RoboRiders, were on a mission to stop a giant, rock-throwing monster, the Swamp Creature, from destroying their world. The story was told primarily through the instruction booklets and the official website. <p>Each of the six main RoboRiders represented a different terrain or element:<p>Ogel (Swamp): The main villain.<p>Dust (Desert)<p>Frost (Ice)<p>Onyx (Rock)<p>Power (City)<p>Lava (Lava) <p>Key Discontinued Sets<p>The sets primarily featured large, buildable action figures made with Bionicle and Technic pieces. A central play feature was the ability to "launch" a disc with the character's unique crest. <p>Swamp (4507): The largest and main villain figure, the Swamp Creature, which launched discs and had a large, imposing appearance.<p>Ogel (4506): This was the original Ogel figure, representing the swamp environment before the larger monster.<p>Frost (4503): The ice-themed rider with a spinning blade feature.<p>Power (4500): The city-themed rider with a disc launcher.<p>Lava (4505): The fire/lava-themed rider.<p>Dust (4501): The desert-themed rider.<p>Onyx (4504): The rock-themed rider. <p>Legacy and Related Themes<p>The RoboRiders theme was one of the early, experimental action figure lines by LEGO. The innovative buildable figures and launching mechanisms were a direct precursor to the highly successful LEGO Bionicle theme, which launched in 2001 and used a more developed version of the same building system. The RoboRiders sets are now collector's items in the secondary market.
