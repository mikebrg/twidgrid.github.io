The LEGO Royal Knights was a popular, discontinued sub-theme of the LEGO Castle line that ran from 1995 to 1996. It introduced a more regal and detailed aesthetic to the castle theme, focusing on King Richard and his forces. <p>Theme Overview<p>The Royal Knights theme centered on the benevolent King Richard and his loyal knights, who were battling the Fright Knights faction led by Basil the Bat Lord in the accompanying storyline. <p>Factions: The Royal Knights were the "good guys", identifiable by their silver armor, red and yellow color scheme, and lion crest (sometimes featuring a crown over the lion). The Fright Knights were the "bad guys" in black and red with bat insignias.<p>Aesthetic: The theme was known for its highly detailed and ornate pieces, including new types of shields and flags, a unique crowned lion helmet crest for the king, and a return to the classic dragon figure.<p>Play Features: Several sets incorporated features like working drawbridges, catapults, and hidden treasure chests for interactive play. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are no longer available new from retailers but can be found on the secondary market. <p>King Leo's Castle (Set number: 6090): The flagship set and primary fortress for the Royal Knights, featuring a drawbridge, dungeon, and a large cast of minifigures including a ghost figure.<p>Royal Drawbridge (Set number: 6078): A standalone drawbridge set that was a popular addition for expanding a castle layout.<p>Royal King's Castle (Set number: 6091): A smaller, alternative castle set released later in the theme's run.<p>Royal Knight (Set number: 6007): A small, affordable set featuring a single knight minifigure on a horse.<p>Royal Chariot (Set number: 6036): Featured the King's ceremonial chariot pulled by a horse. <p>Successor and Modern Connections<p>The Royal Knights theme was directly succeeded by the LEGO Fright Knights theme in 1997, which focused on the villains. In 2022, The LEGO Group released the highly detailed LEGO Icons Lion Knights' Castle (set 10305), a large-scale adult collector's set that serves as a modern homage to all the classic 1980s and 1990s castle themes, including the design principles of the Royal Knights.
