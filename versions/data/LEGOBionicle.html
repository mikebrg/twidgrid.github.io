LEGO Bionicle was a massively successful, story-driven, discontinued line of buildable action figures that ran from 2001 to 2010 and was briefly rebooted from 2015 to 2016. It is credited with helping save The LEGO Group from financial crisis in the early 2000s. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>Unlike most LEGO themes, Bionicle was supported by an extensive multimedia story told through comics, books, games, and films. The narrative blended science fantasy with Polynesian culture and mythology, focusing on biomechanical beings. 
The primary story revolved around the Toa, heroic elemental warriors, whose destiny was to protect the Matoran (the villagers) from the evil Makuta Teridax and his minions. The first saga concluded with the heroes successfully reawakening their creator and guardian, the Great Spirit Mata Nui. <p>The 2015 reboot featured a new, separate storyline on the island of Okoto, where a new team of Toa (named after the originals) battled the forces of evil led by Umarak the Hunter. <p>Key Product Features<p>Buildable Action Figures: Bionicle sets utilized a specialized ball-and-socket building system derived from the earlier Slizers and RoboRiders themes, allowing for poseable, articulated figures.<p>Collectible Masks: A central element was the Kanohi masks, which granted special powers in the story and were highly collectible. The early sets often had a play feature to "knock the mask off" the figures.<p>Gear Functions: Many early sets incorporated gearboxes, allowing for simple action features like swinging arms or extending necks. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>Due to the theme's popularity, many sets have become iconic collector's items. <p>Toa Mata (2001 Toa Tahu, Lewa, Gali, Kopaka, Pohatu, Onua): The original six heroes released in canisters, known for their bright colors and simple gear functions.<p>Bohrok (2002): Robotic drones that could fold into their canisters and were designed to cleanse the island of Mata Nui.<p>Vezon and Fenrakk (2006): A popular "Titan" set featuring a villain and his large, buildable steed.<p>Maxilos & Spinax (2007): A fan-favorite large set praised for its solid design and weapon loadout. <p>Current Status<p>The Bionicle theme is currently discontinued, having ended its second run in 2016. In 2023, a special promotional Gift-with-Purchase set of Tahu and Takua was released for a limited time, a nod to the dedicated fanbase. The sets are no longer produced by LEGO and can only be found through re-sellers.
