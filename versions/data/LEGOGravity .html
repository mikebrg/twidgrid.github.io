The term "Lego Gravity 2003" refers to the short-lived, discontinued LEGO Sports: Gravity Games sub-theme released in 2003. <p>LEGO Sports: Gravity Games Theme<p>This product line was based on the real-world Gravity Games, an annual extreme sports competition. The sets were designed for interactive tabletop play, allowing users to build custom skate and snowboard parks and perform stunts with minifigures. <p>Release Year: 2003<p>Focus: Extreme sports, including skateboarding and snowboarding.<p>Key Feature: The sets included "stunt sticks," which were clear plastic poles used to control the minifigures and help them perform tricks and "catch air" on the ramps.<p>Minifigures: The minifigures featured the classic yellow skin tone and were designed to mimic extreme sports athletes. <p>Notable Sets from the Theme<p>There were only three main sets in this sub-theme, making it one of the smaller LEGO themes.<p>Skateboard Vert Park Challenge (Set number: 3584): This set featured a large half-pipe ramp design, allowing for vert skateboarding action. It included various ramp elements and two minifigures.<p>Skateboard Street Park (Set number: 3535): This set focused on "street" style skateboarding, with obstacles like stairs, handrails, and benches for grinding and tricks. It also included two minifigures.<p>Snowboard Super Pipe (Set number: 3585): This set shifted the focus to winter sports, featuring a large super pipe ramp for snowboarding stunts. <p>The theme was a unique experiment in combining traditional LEGO building with interactive, game-oriented play features, though it was discontinued after just one year.
