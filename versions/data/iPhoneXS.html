The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. Released as the twelfth-generation flagship models of the iPhone, they succeeded the iPhone X and were unveiled alongside the more affordable iPhone XR on September 12, 2018, during a keynote address by Apple CEO Tim Cook at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park. Pre-orders began on September 14, 2018, with general availability starting September 21, 2018. The iPhone XS and XS Max introduced improvements over their predecessor, including enhanced processing power, dual-SIM functionality, improved water resistance, and stereo audio recording for video capture.<p>At WWDC 2024, Apple announced that the iPhone XS, alongside the iPhone XR, would support iOS 18, making these devices the oldest iPhones compatible with the latest iOS version at the time. This decision also makes the iPhone XS one of the oldest supported smartphones ever, alongside the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, receiving seven years of major iOS version updates.<p>Apple positioned the iPhone XS and XS Max as premium devices, targeting consumers seeking cutting-edge performance and advanced features, while simultaneously offering the iPhone XR – a lower-cost alternative with the same Apple A12 Bionic chip, but an LCD IPS panel display and a singular camera.<p>Along with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone XS and XS Max were discontinued on September 10, 2019, following the announcement of the 13th generation of iPhone; the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max.
