LEGO Boat and ship sets, with hull pieces that float
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The first LEGO boat sets with hull pieces designed to float were introduced in 1972. These initial sets were part of the LEGOLAND theme and used specialized, multi-piece hull assemblies to ensure buoyancy. <p>Overview of 1972 Floating Boat Sets<p>The 1972 release marked a significant step in LEGO's history, as it allowed children to play with their creations in water. These sets did not include minifigures, as they were introduced later. <p>Design: The hulls were constructed from multiple large, molded plastic sections (bow, stern, and middle sections) that snapped together to form a watertight base. A weighted keel piece was often attached to the bottom to provide stability and keep the boat upright in the water.<p>Motorization: A key feature of these floating hulls was a notch on the bottom designed to attach a small, third-party electric motor, allowing the boats to move under their own power in a bathtub or pool. <p>Specific 1972 Sets <p>The initial release included a variety of boats covering different commercial and emergency roles: <p>LEGO 401 Cabin Cruiser: A leisure boat set built on the floating hull pieces.<p>LEGO 402 Fire Boat: An emergency services set that was a precursor to many future fire boat models, featuring the floating hull.<p>LEGO 403 Police Boat: A law enforcement themed boat that was also designed for water play.<p>LEGO 404 Tug Boat: A workboat model that proved popular for its simple design and functionality.<p>LEGO 405 Speedboat: A smaller, faster-looking boat set within the initial floating hull range. <p>These early floating boat sets established a popular sub-theme that continued for decades, with new hull designs introduced over the years.
