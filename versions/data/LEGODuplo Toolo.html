LEGO Duplo Toolo was a discontinued sub-theme of the LEGO DUPLO line that ran from 1992 to around 2001, designed to introduce young children to basic engineering and the use of tools. It promoted the development of fine motor skills by letting children build and take apart vehicles using specially designed screwdrivers and wrenches. <p>Theme Overview<p>The sets used the larger, toddler-friendly DUPLO bricks but incorporated unique elements with integrated screws and connectors. The main play pattern involved using the included tools to assemble or disassemble models, primarily construction and rescue vehicles. "Action Wheelers" and "Tech Machines" were follow-up lines that continued this tool-based building concept. <p>Key Features<p>Tools: Each set included child-safe screwdrivers or wrenches, allowing children aged 3 to 6 to physically "screw" and "unscrew" parts.<p>Fine Motor Skill Development: The use of tools and specific connectors helped develop fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination.<p>Compatibility: Most Toolo bricks were compatible with standard DUPLO bricks, allowing for integrated play as children grew older.<p>Vehicles: The theme focused heavily on popular vehicle types, such as fire trucks, dumper trucks, mobile cranes, and even space center vehicles. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are no longer available for retail purchase but can be found through re-sellers on online marketplaces. <p>Fire Truck (2940): A popular set featuring a fire engine and firefighter figures, including a unique screwdriver and wrench.<p>Dumper Truck (2910): One of the initial sets, featuring a construction worker figure and a dumper truck that could be built with the included tools.<p>Mobile Crane (2930): This set included a functional mobile crane and construction worker figures, focusing on heavy machinery.<p>Space Centre (2945): A more unique set for the theme, which featured space-themed elements and specific tools for assembly.
