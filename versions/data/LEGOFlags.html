LEGO offers a diverse selection of flag pieces ranging from solid-color tiles used to build custom national flags to specific printed or stickered pieces featuring emblems, logos, and historical designs. They come in various shapes and sizes for use in different sets and scales. <p>Types of LEGO Flag Elements<p>LEGO produces flag elements in plastic and, for some historical themes, a cloth-like material, designed to attach to bars or other elements using clips or specialized connectors. <p>Plastic Flag Pieces: Most common in modern sets, these are solid plastic elements that provide a rigid, consistent look.<p>2x2 Square (Part 2335): A popular, small square flag, often used in multiples or for small details.<p>2x4 Triangular (Part 5555): A classic triangular pennant shape, frequently used in Castle and Space themes.<p>6x4 Rectangle (Part 2525): A larger rectangular flag, often with two connection points, used for larger ships or significant buildings.<p>"Wave" Streamers (Part 4495): These 1x4 pieces feature a flowing shape, often used as smaller decorative banners.
7x3 with Bar Handle (Part 30292): A flag designed to be held by a minifigure's hands, making it ideal for parades or battle scenes.<p>Cloth/Fabric Flags: Historically, especially in themes like the original LEGO Castle (1978) and Pirates (late 1980s), LEGO included soft fabric flags with printed designs. These offer a more dynamic, waving appearance.<p>Printed vs. Stickered: Many flag designs are printed directly onto the plastic pieces, which provides a durable and high-quality finish. In other cases, a basic blank flag piece is provided, and a sticker is applied to create the design, which is a common cost-saving measure for unique designs. <p>Common Themes and Designs<p>LEGO flags feature a vast array of designs, often unique to specific themes:<p>Castle Emblems: Featuring designs like the Lion Knights' lion head, the Black Falcons' emblem, or dragons, these flags signify different factions and kingdoms.<p>Pirate Themes: Iconic "Jolly Roger" skull and crossbones designs were prevalent in Pirate sets.<p>Space Logos: Classic Space, Blacktron, and other sub-themes had distinct logos and colors featured on flags in their bases and vehicles.<p>National Flags (Third-Party): While official LEGO sets rarely include specific real-world national flags (the "International Flags" supplemental set from the 1970s was a rare exception), the LEGO building community has created instructions and even custom printed parts to build a wide variety of world flags from standard bricks.<p>Licensed Themes: Flags for licensed properties, such as the Gryffindor emblem in the Harry Potter sets or logos from Star Wars and Speed Champions, are also available.
