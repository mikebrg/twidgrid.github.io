The LEGO Castle theme, one of the three original LEGO play themes, launched in 1978 with a single, now iconic, set: the LEGO Set 375 Castle. This set established the foundation for the entire medieval line that followed. <p>The Iconic Yellow Castle (Set 375)<p>The 1978 Castle set is often referred to by fans as the "Yellow Castle" due to its distinctive yellow walls, a color choice that changed to grey in later, more "realistic" castle sets from 1984 onwards. <p>Pieces and Minifigures: The set contained 767 pieces and an impressive 14 of the new minifigures, which had just been introduced that same year.<p>Design: The castle was designed to be hinged, allowing it to open up for more accessible play space. It featured a red drawbridge with a working chain mechanism.<p>Minifigure Details: The included knights wore breastplates and helmets with unique movable visors, a feature specific to this early "Classic Castle" era.<p>Horses: The set came with four horses, which, unlike the molded horse figures of later years (introduced in 1984), were built entirely from standard LEGO bricks and plates.<p>Aesthetics: The set heavily relied on basic bricks and plates, with details like coats of arms and shields applied via a large sticker sheet, rather than printed bricks. <p>The Yellow Castle remained in production for several years and was reissued in the US as LEGO Set 6075 Castle in 1981, becoming one of the most beloved and recognizable sets in LEGO history.
