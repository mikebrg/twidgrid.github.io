The LEGO Futuron theme was a popular, discontinued sub-theme of the LEGO Space line that ran from 1987 to 1990. It was positioned as the primary "good guy" faction in space, focused on peaceful exploration, research, and general colonization. <p>Theme Overview and Storyline<p>The storyline depicted the Futuron faction as a unified and highly organized group of astronauts, identifiable by their uniform white and blue color scheme. They were primarily tasked with exploring new planets, setting up bases, and discovering new technologies. Their activities often put them in conflict with the villainous Blacktron I faction, who sought to steal their cargo and technology. <p>Key features of the sets included:<p>Color Scheme: The vehicles featured an iconic white and blue color scheme with red and transparent blue elements, a staple of classic LEGO Space.<p>Magnets: A core play feature was the use of magnet cranes and attachment points. Many vehicles were equipped with a magnetic crane arm to pick up cargo containers and various tools.<p>Minifigures: The minifigures wore white and blue uniforms with a clear visor helmet, a variation of the classic astronaut uniform.<p>Modular Design: While not as prevalent as in later themes, many sets were designed to interact with each other and featured standard connections for expanding bases or linking vehicles. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are now highly sought-after collector's items and are only available on the secondary market from re-sellers. <p>Futuron Monorail Transport System (6990): The flagship set and one of the most iconic LEGO products ever released, featuring an electric monorail, a base, and a transport vehicle. It is one of the most valuable discontinued LEGO sets.<p>Futuron Command Center (6972): The primary base of operations for the faction, a large ground station with various vehicles, radar, and a central command area.<p>Space Port Voyager (6953): A large spacecraft that could separate into multiple smaller vehicles and carry cargo containers with the magnet crane system.<p>Solar Power Transporter (6882): A ground vehicle with a large solar panel and the ability to transport cargo containers.<p>FX Star Patroller (6861): A smaller, basic patrol ship. <p>Legacy and Related Themes<p>Blacktron I (1987-1988): The primary criminal faction in this storyline.<p>Space Police I (1989-1990): The law enforcement faction dedicated to capturing Blacktron I criminals.<p>Modern Homage: In 2022, as part of the LEGO Group's 90th-anniversary celebrations, the Galaxy Explorer (10497) set included minifigure torsos with the classic Futuron logo as a direct homage to the fan-favorite theme.
