The LEGO Wild West (also known as the Western theme) was a popular, discontinued product line from 1996 to 1997 that depicted the Old West era of the United States. It featured minifigures of cowboys, outlaws, U.S. Cavalry soldiers, and Native Americans. <p>Theme Overview and Legacy<p>The theme was one of the first to introduce realistic firearms (revolvers and rifles) and minifigure heads with varied facial expressions, a departure from the standard perpetual smile. It was inspired by classic "Spaghetti Western" films. <p>The theme was known for its detailed buildings and environments, including a town called "Legoredo Town," an army fort, and a Native American village along a river. Three of the most iconic sets from the original run were re-released in 2002 due to popular demand. <p>Notable Discontinued Sets<p>These sets are no longer available for retail purchase but can be found on the secondary market. <p>Fort Legoredo (Set number: 6762/6769): The flagship set and base of the U.S. Cavalry, featuring six soldier minifigures, a jail, and various play features.<p>Gold City Junction (Set number: 6765): A detailed set including a bank, a general store, a covered wagon, and six minifigures, including a sheriff and the bandit Black Bart.<p>Bandits' Secret Hideout (Set number: 6761): The hideout for the outlaws, often featuring a mine or cliffside structure.<p>Rapid River Village (Set number: 6763/6766): Focused on the Native American (Indians) part of the theme, featuring tipis, a totem pole, and a canoe, along with several Native American minifigures.<p>Sheriff's Lock-up (Set number: 6755/6764): A smaller set focused on the town's law enforcement and a simple jail. <p>Modern Connections<p>While no ongoing "Wild West" theme exists today, the concept has appeared in other forms: <p>The LEGO Movie themes: The character "President Business" had a Wild West counterpart in the first movie, and a train set featured a western theme.<p>The Lone Ranger theme (2013): A brief, licensed theme that acted as a thematic replacement for the classic Western sets, including a large train set.<p>LEGO BrickLink Designer Program: A fan-designed "Wild West Train" and "Wild West General Store" were successfully crowdfunded and produced as limited-edition sets, demonstrating continued fan interest in the theme.
