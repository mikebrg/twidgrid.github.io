LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game is a 2005 action-adventure game that covers the events of the Star Wars prequel trilogy and established the now-famous gameplay formula for most future LEGO titles. The game is no longer widely available through official digital storefronts but can be played via its combined form, LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga. <p>Game Details<p>Content: The game adapts the storylines of Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith with signature LEGO humor. It also features a bonus level based on the opening of Episode IV: A New Hope.<p>Gameplay: It introduced core mechanics like cooperative two-player gameplay, Free Play mode to revisit levels with any unlocked characters, and collecting "studs" (the in-game currency) to unlock secrets and extra content. Characters have specific abilities, such as Jedi and Sith using the Force and lightsabers, and droids being able to access special panels.<p>Characters: There are over 50 playable characters, all of whom communicate through mumbles and grunts rather than voice acting.<p>Hub World: Dexter's Diner serves as the central hub where players can select levels, view collectibles, and purchase extras. <p>Availability<p>The original game was released on various platforms including PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Windows PC, Mac, and Game Boy Advance. It is no longer in production, and digital versions are not officially sold on most modern platforms. <p>However, the game's levels were incorporated into LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga, which combined the prequel and original trilogy games into a single, updated experience. The Complete Saga is widely available for modern platforms like PC (Steam), Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, iOS, and Android, and is generally the recommended way to experience the original game's content. <p>Additionally, all nine Skywalker Saga films, including the three in the original game, are covered in the more recent and expansive LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga released in 2022.
