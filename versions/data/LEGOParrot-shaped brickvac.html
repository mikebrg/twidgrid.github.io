Yes, a discontinued LEGO Brick Vac (vacuum/scooper for bricks) was produced with a parrot pattern on it in the 1990s. <p>LEGO "Polly Pick Up" Brick Vac (Discontinued)<p>This accessory was a manual scooper designed to help pick up small LEGO bricks from the floor.<p>Design: It was a yellow plastic scooper with a colorful parrot pattern (decal or print) on the front.<p>Functionality: It was not an electric vacuum in the traditional sense, but a manual rolling device that would scoop up bricks as it was pushed along a hard floor.<p>Availability: The item was released around 1993 (set 1874) and is no longer produced by The LEGO Group. It can only be found on the secondary market from re-sellers like BrickLink and eBay, where it is a vintage and somewhat rare collector's item. <p>Modern Alternatives
For those looking for modern solutions for picking up bricks, The LEGO Group does not offer a current vacuum solution, but third-party options exist: <p>Third-Party Toy Vacuums: Products like "Pick-Up Bricks" are toy vacuums designed with strong suction motors to safely clean up LEGO bricks and other small toys.<p>Modern LEGO Brick Separator: LEGO includes a simple, official "brick separator" tool in many larger sets, primarily for separating tough-to-remove plates and tiles, not for vacuuming the floor.<p>Brick-Built Parrots: For those who love the parrot design, the current LEGO Creator 3-in-1 line offers sets like the Exotic Parrot (set 31136), which builds a poseable parrot from standard bricks.
