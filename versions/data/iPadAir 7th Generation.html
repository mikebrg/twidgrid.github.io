The seventh-generation iPad Air, marketed as the iPad Air (M3), is a series of tablet computers developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It was announced on March 4, 2025, and released on March 12, 2025. The device succeeds the iPad Air (6th generation) and introduces several hardware, performance, and accessory improvements while maintaining the same starting price as its predecessor.<p>The seventh-generation iPad Air is powered by Apple’s M3 chip. According to Apple, M3 offers up to 35 percent faster multithreaded CPU performance and up to 40 percent faster graphics than M1. Additionally, the M3 introduces hardware-accelerated ray tracing, mesh shading, and dynamic caching. This results in smoother, more realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections for demanding applications such as 3D rendering and high-end gaming. The M3’s Neural Engine is up to 60 percent faster than that of the M1, enabling improved AI and machine learning tasks within iPadOS.<p>The iPad Air (M3) continues to be offered an 11-inch and 13-inch variant. Like the previous generation, both sizes feature a Liquid Retina display with P3 wide color and True Tone technology. Storage options include 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB, and all configurations are equipped with 8 GB of unified memory. except for the removal of the iPad Air branding in the lower midsection.
