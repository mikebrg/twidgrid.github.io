The second generation of the HERO cameras (2010–11) were branded HD HERO for their upgraded resolution, now offering up to 1080p high-definition video. With the HD HERO generation, GoPro replaced the optical viewfinder with an optional LCD monitor.<p>The basic HD HERO was marketed either with a basic set of accessories (case and mount) as the "Naked" or in bundles with additional accessories named for the intended purpose (such as the HD Helmet HERO, HD Motorsports HERO, and HD Surf HERO). For all HD HERO variants, the camera shoots a maximum of 1080p video with a reduced field of view (127°) on its 5 MP sensor. Alternative resolutions for the HD HERO included 960p30, 720p60, 720p30, and 480p60, with the same wide-angle (170°) view as the previous-generation Wide HERO. It was first listed on January 25, 2010.<p>The HD HERO also offered an expansion port on the camera's rear panel, branded the HERO Bus. Optional accessories included the LCD Bakpac, which offered a small monitor that displayed and played back video, and the Battery Bakpac, which doubled the battery life of the camera.
