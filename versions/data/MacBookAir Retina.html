The MacBook Air Retina model released on October 30, 2018, was a major overhaul that introduced a stunning 13.3-inch Retina display, Touch ID, the T2 Security Chip, and a more compact, 100% recycled aluminum design. It transitioned entirely to Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, dropping all legacy connectivity options. <p>Key Features and Ports<p>Retina Display: A key upgrade from previous Air models, offering a significantly higher 2560x1600 resolution with 48% more color than the prior generation.<p>Touch ID & T2 Chip: Integrated Touch ID fingerprint sensor for secure authentication and Apple Pay, powered by the Apple T2 Security Chip, which also provided an encrypted SSD controller and "Hey Siri" functionality.<p>Design: A thinner and lighter aluminum unibody enclosure, available in gold, silver, and space gray finishes. It was also the first Mac made from 100% recycled aluminum.<p>Keyboard and Trackpad: Featured an updated third-generation butterfly mechanism keyboard (which was also backlit) and a 20% larger Force Touch trackpad.<p>Ports: Connectivity was limited to two multi-purpose Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, which supported charging, Thunderbolt (up to 40 Gbps), and USB 3.1 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gbps). A single 3.5 mm headphone jack was also included.<p>Missing Ports: This model lacked USB-A ports, an SD card slot, and an Ethernet port, requiring external adapters for these connections.
