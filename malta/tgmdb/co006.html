Christian Service Community

The Christian Service Community (CSC) is a group of youths and adults who have answered Jesus’ call to love each other as he loved us. Through regular weekly meetings and various weekend activities, members endeavour to further discover God’s presence in their lives, and to foster a sense of genuine friendship. The CSC is one of three groups with different age ranges, which together make up the Friendship Group, a Christian movement founded by Fr Joseph Orr SJ, way back in 1973. The CSC welcomes individuals whose age falls roughly between 25 and 40 years. Members come from all walks of life, and it is a firm view of the community that no distinction based on status or class should be allowed to hold sway within the group. Through the years which have passed since the community’s formation, various teachers, nurses, labourers, accountants, soldiers, and administrative officials, have together contributed to create a sense of vibrant and honest friendship. While the group is primarily intentioned for single people, many couples have counted among its members over the years. The CSC holds its meetings every Tuesday at its Floriana premises. While many of the meetings are of a spiritual character, meetings are also held about subjects of general interest, like psychology, art, health, and personal development. The meetings are often animated by powerpoint presentations. Weekend activities vary, and include cultural visits, birthday parties, eating out, and attendance of concerts and performances. The community has also been associated with voluntary work, and continues to be concerned about reaching out to those in need.
