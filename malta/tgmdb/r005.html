Malta is subdivided into 6 regions. The Regional Level of Government is relatively young as a system of governance in Malta. Six Regional Councils were established and set-up through the amendment of the Local Councils Act in 2019 which established the Southern (Nofsinhar) Regional Council as one of the 6 Regional Councils of the Maltese Islands.
