Nationalist Governments

Between 1964 and 1971, Malta experienced significant transformation under Nationalist Party governments following its independence from Britain in 1964. Led by Prime Minister George Borg Olivier, the period was marked by efforts to establish Malta as a sovereign nation. The government focused on economic diversification, infrastructure development, and strengthening ties with Western nations, including membership in the United Nations and the Council of Europe. Despite progress, challenges such as economic dependence on British military spending and internal political tensions persisted, setting the stage for subsequent shifts in Malta's political landscape.
