There are no signs of this surname on the Maltese islands until 1519 and it was more common by the seventeenth century as per the Status Animarum (diocesan census).



Of two potential Semitic origins, al-tawmi refers to "a grower or vendor of garlic" whilst tawm means "twin brother". The latter derives from the Aramaic t'ôma and is the root of the name Thomas.
