The Old Church of Santa Venera (Maltese: Knisja l-Qadima ta' Santa Venera) is a Roman Catholic church in Santa Venera, Malta, dedicated to saint of the same name. It was built between 1658 and 1688 on a site of a 15th-century church. It was the town's parish church from 1918 to 1989, when the parish was transferred to the new Santa Venera Parish Church.
