Mtarfa F.C. is a football club from Mtarfa, the home of a former big British forces barracks area in central Malta. Founded in 2006, the club took part for the first time in their history in the 2007/2008 season. They entered the Malta Football Association in lieu of Ta' Xbiex S.C., who lost their status due consistently poor results in the lowest of Maltese divisions. They currently play in the Maltese National Amateur League B. They also play in the annual Maltese FA Trophy.
