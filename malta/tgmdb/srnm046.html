This surname dates back to the Late Middle Ages with roots in Sicily from at least 1095. The town of Ħal-Qormi means “the farmstead of the Curmi family”.



It could refer to the Italian place name Curma, itself from colma meaning “high water (spring)”, or from the Greek kurmos meaning “truncated log'. Siculo-Arabic origins could include kurmi, “a native of Crimea”, or karmi meaning “generous, noble”.



A dexter (from the right) arm is representative of prosperity, merit and qualities of leadership, whilst the flaming heart is symbolic of unrivalled passion.
