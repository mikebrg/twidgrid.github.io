Malta has had its share of murders. But in Summer 2012, the people are afraid to go out alone. There is a killer on the loose. No one knows who or what s/he looks like. However, when a person is reported missing, the same person is found dead after eight days. Detective Eric James and Dylan are the ones heading the case.
