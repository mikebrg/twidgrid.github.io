In the year 1889, near the statue of Saint Sebastian, which had been raised in thanksgiving after the plague of 1813, a church dedicated to Saint Sebastian was built, which in 1918 became a vice-parish and a parish in 1936. The church was too small for the people so another church was built a little further away.
