Emmanuel Mallia is a Maltese politician. He was the Minister for Home Affairs and National Security of the Republic of Malta. Following an alleged "cover-up" within his ministry, he was removed from office by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat on 9 December 2014 and replaced by Carmelo Abela. In 2016, Mallia returned to the cabinet as Minister for Competitiveness and Digital, Maritime and Services Economy, a portfolio which he retained until the 2017 general election. Mallia remained an MP in the Maltese Parliament until 2021, when he resigned to become Malta's UK High Commissioner.
