The Parish Church of Saint Joseph (Maltese: Knisja Parrokjali ta' San Ġużepp) is an iconic Roman Catholic parish church in Manikata, Malta, dedicated to Saint Joseph. It was designed by Richard England in 1962, and it was built between 1964 and 1974. The church marks a break from traditional church building designs, and it is an example of Critical regionalism. Its form is inspired by the girna, a traditional corbelled stone hut.
