Agape Malta is a Christian missionary movement that shares the mission of Agape Europe in Making Jesus Known. Agape Europe is an umbrella of missionary organisations established in various European countries. Agape is the Greek word used in the Bible for God’s Love. Our mission is to bring spiritual hope and help to people in Europe as we shares God’s love. We strives to be relevant to the societies being served, and that strategies and actions are culturally appropriate and attractive, but without compromising on Biblical values. We seek to fulfil the Great Commission in cooperation with the whole body of Christ by building movements of multiplying disciples so that everyone may know someone who truly follows Jesus.
