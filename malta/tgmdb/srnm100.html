Listed as Xiklune, this surname can be found on the Militia Roster of 1417, with De Scicli being documented in 1419.



Potentially from the Old Sicilian descent chachaluni, itself from the Arabic akhal (plural: kuhlun) meaning ‘dark haired’. Another source may link this surname to the commune of Scicli, near Ragusa, itself coming from the Sikeloi tribe, who gave Sicily its name.



Horses in heraldry represent good values and worthiness, whilst the moon is auspicious with good fortune.
