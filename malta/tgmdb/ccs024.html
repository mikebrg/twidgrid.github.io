St Theresa School

To provide the moulding of children’s characters primarily in the love of God and love of neighbours and to provide a holistic education which will encourage them to be honest and upstanding citizens - an education which conveys culture in a sincere way, not forgetting the substance of our faith and that awakens social responsibility. Education is imparted by the activity of a community which recognises and proclaims certain specific values. This community has its inspiration in Our Lady of Mount Carmel as a model of life, and seeks to live always in the presence of God, praising and loving Him, as well as practicing the ‘Little Way’ taught by St. Theresa of Lisieux, doing little things with love.
