Mdina (Maltese: L-Imdina [lɪmˈdiːnɐ]; Phoenician: 𐤌𐤋𐤈, romanized: Maleṭ; Ancient Greek: Μελίττη, romanized: Melíttē; Arabic: مدينة, romanized: Madīnah; Italian: Medina), also known by its Italian-language titles Città Vecchia ('Old City') and Città Notabile ('Notable City'), is a fortified city in the Northern Region of Malta which served as the island's capital from antiquity to the medieval period. The city is still confined within its walls, and has a population of just under 100, but it is contiguous with the town of Rabat, which takes its name from the Arabic word for suburb, and has a population of over 11,000 (as of March 2014).
