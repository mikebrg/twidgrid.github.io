We first encounter this surname in the Militria Roser of 1417, with the Maltese village of Ħal-Balzan referring to the farmstead of the Balzan family.



Likely from the Italian surname Balzano/i, itself from the Latin balzanus, meaning "odd, quaint". It may also come from a Sicilian nickname referring to someone with streaks of white in their hair.



The garb of wheat, a rare charge in Maltese heraldry, represents domestic virtues of prosperity, hospitality and hope. It is shown over a lozenge in gules (red), symbolising honesty, constancy, and nobility
