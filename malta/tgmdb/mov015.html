The film tells the story of a 15-year-old country girl Katarin (Anna Straface) who starts to become a woman. Here the director (Cecil Satariano) brings before us a village girl with all the contrasts between the innocent life of the typical Maltese village and the modern world of that Malta was shifting into at that point in time.
