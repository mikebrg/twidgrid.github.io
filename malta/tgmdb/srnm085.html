Amongst the earliest recorded instances of this surname we find Berningerius Muscat, a landowner, living in 1372.



In Sicily, moscato (from the Latin, muscatus meaning "musky") is a term associated with winemaking. Whilst the Arabic term, masqat ir-ras refers to "one’s place of birth", lending itself to the names of various Arabic towns and cities (such as Muscat in Oman).



Flies in heraldry are symbols of harvest and industriousness, though are more likely to be included in this crest since the Italian for fly is mosca. Another version of this coat of arms incorporates a grapevine.
