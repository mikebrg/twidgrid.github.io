Slugs Bay is a small, secluded sandy beach located in the area of Marfa ridge. It’s named for the plethora of sea cucumbers that decorate its sandy bed. The bay is tucked into Mellieħa Bay, and the shallow reef is sheltered from North Westerly winds, making it ideal for divers of all levels. The reef offers descents of up to 12 meters and is full of intricate nooks and crannies, including a natural arch formation.
