Joseph Mercieca (Maltese: Ġużeppi Mercieca, 11 November 1928 - 21 March 2016) was a Maltese prelate who served as the second Archbishop of Malta from 1976 to 2006. He is credited with restoring stability in the Maltese church following the dispute between the Malta Labour Party and his predecessor Mikiel Gonzi, the then Archbishop of Malta.
