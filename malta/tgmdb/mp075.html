Justin Schembri (born 3rd March 1982) is a dynamic Maltese politician affiliated with the Nationalist Party. Elected to Parliament in the 2022 Maltese general election from District 8. with an impressive 3976 votes, Schembri emerged as the standout candidate on the National Party's ticket on the 8th District. He is the Opposition's Shadow Minister for Education. Schembri's journey into politics began in 2014 when he was invited by the Party's Deputy Leader, Beppe Fenech Adami to be part of an internal Policy Forum. Recognizing his potential, in September of the same year, at the request of the then Leader of the Nationalist Party Simon Busuttil, Justin Schembri was announced as a Candidate for the General Elections on behalf of the Nationalist Party in September 2014. He addressed his first General Council on 30 November 2014 with the theme Honest Politics. He articulated his commitment to making a positive impact on the Nationalist Party, despite being relatively new to the political scene. In 2017, he contested unsuccessfully the General Election in which he obtained more than 600 first count votes. Furthermore, in 2019 Justin Schembri was elected as Minority Leader on Birkirkara's Local Council obtaining 2,543 votes or 44.2% of the votes of the Nationalist Party which in total managed 43.67% in the locality. On 27 July 2019, in a difficult period for the Nationalist Party, Justin Schembri addressed the Extraordinary General Council before a vote of confidence was taken in the then Party Leader Adrian Delia. In his speech, Justin Schembri said that he was there to defend the legacy of democracy and the rule of law and to defend the weapon that we must humbly understand its significance. He said that "we cannot save the democracy of the country if we do not save the democracy within the Nationalist Party". He concluded by saying that anyone who really believes in democracy, should choose unity and unity, because the Nationalist Party is not the councillors but the thousands of members who have already made a democratic choice. Adrian Delia was confirmed Leader of the Party after 67% voted in favour.
