Margaritus of Brindisi (also Margarito; Italian: Margaritone, Greek: Megareites or Margaritoni [Μαργαριτώνη]; c. 1149 - 1197), called 'the new Neptune', was the last great ammiratus ammiratorum (Grand Admiral) of the Kingdom of Sicily. Following in the footsteps of Christodulus, George of Antioch, and Maio of Bari, Margaritus commanded the kingdom's fleets during the reigns of William II (1166-1189) and Tancred (1189-1194). He probably began as a Greek pirate and gradually rose to the rank of privateer before becoming a permanent admiral of the navy. In 1185, he became the first count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos (or Zante). In 1192, he became the first Count of Malta. He also held the titles of Prince of Taranto and Duke of Durazzo.
