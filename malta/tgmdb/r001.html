As of January 2022, Malta became subdivided into six regions - Gozo, Tramuntana, Punent, Lvant, Nofsinhar, and Port. These Regional Councils were established and set-up through the amendment of the Local Councils Act in 2019 which led to a change in name as well in its composition. Regjun Centru became Regjun Lvant and is now composed of twelve localities - Bikirkara, Iklin, Ħal Lija, San Ġiljan, Sliema, Gżira, Għargħur, Pietà, Swieqi, Pembroke, Imsida, and Ta’ Xbiex.
