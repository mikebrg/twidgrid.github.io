St Catherine's Monastery (Maltese: Monasteru Santa Katerina ta' Lixandra) is a monastery in Valletta, Malta which houses cloistered nuns of the Second Order of Saint Augustine. It incorporates the Church of the Presentation of Our Lady (Maltese: Knisja tal-Preżentazzjoni tal-Madonna), which is more commonly known as the Church of St Catherine (Maltese: Knisja ta' Santa Katerina). The church and monastery were built in the 18th century and they replaced a previous monastery which had been housed in a 16th-century palace.
