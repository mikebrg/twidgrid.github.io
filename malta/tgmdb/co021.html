The University Students’ Catholic Movement was founded as the Lega Universitaria Cattolica Maltese on the 5th April 1929 by Fr. Daniel Callus O.P., professor of Holy Scripture at the University with the aim of training students in their Christian witness at the University. Throughout the following decades, several changes in the structure and also in the name of the movement took place, and these helped to strengthen its activity at the University. Today, by means of several activities throughout the year, the Movement promotes Christian values on campus and takes initiatives in social commitment. On an international level, MKSU is a full and active member of JECIMIEC - the European Coordination of Catholic Students’ Movements.
