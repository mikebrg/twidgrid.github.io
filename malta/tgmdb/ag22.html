Dr. Giacomo Pantaleone Bruno was Malta's first Crown Advocate, serving from 1839 to 1842. This position replaced the earlier role of Attorney General following a 1839 ordinance issued by the British colonial administration. The Crown Advocate was tasked with prosecuting criminal cases on behalf of the Crown and was prohibited from engaging in private legal practice, although existing clients could still be represented in ongoing cases. <p>During his tenure, Dr. Bruno played a significant role in drafting legislation related to the freedom of the press, a topic that was particularly contentious during British rule. His work in this area left a lasting impact on Malta's legal landscape. <p>In 1843, Dr. Bruno transitioned from his role as Crown Advocate to become a judge. He continued to serve in the judiciary until his retirement in 1860 and passed away in 1868. <p>Dr. Bruno's legacy is notable not only for his legal contributions but also for his role in shaping Malta's legal system during a period of significant transition under British colonial rule.
