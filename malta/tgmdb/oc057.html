The Old Church of St Sebastian (Maltese: Il-Knisja l-Qadima ta' San Bastjan), commonly known as il-knisja ż-żgħira (Maltese for 'the small church'), is a Roman Catholic church in Qormi, Malta, dedicated to Saint Sebastian. It was built between 1880 and 1890 near a statue of the saint which had been erected in 1815 to commemorate deliverance from a plague epidemic in 1813. It was a parish church between 1935 and the 1980s, when a larger parish church with the same dedication was built nearby. The building was only formally consecrated in 2019, and it is now used as an adoration chapel.
