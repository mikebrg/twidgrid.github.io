This surname is almost certainly has its origins in the Arabic surname Deif or Dejf, meaning “guest”, itself an abbreviation of Dejfallah, meaning  “servant of God”. It was mistranslated to Magro, the Italian for “lean, thin” in the 16th century.



As Deif, we find this surname documented in Malta in the year 1419, whilst Magro emerges in 1504.



The flowers on the coat of arms are symbols of joy and hope whilst the argent (white/silver) lion, shown naissant or emerging from an ordinary, is a symbol of power and courage in relation to faith.
