LIFT - Living In Friendship Together - is the motto of a new youth group that was founded by seven members whom together we give our utmost to get to know and entertain other youth like us. Behind it all, is Fr. Ray Francalanza, who went out of his way to see that in the midst of the entertainment’s Mecca, Paceville, forms this group of young people at the Millennium Chapel - a chapel run by Augustinian monks.
