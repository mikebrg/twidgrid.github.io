This surname can be found in the secretus of Malta of 1397, with roots in Sicily dating back to at least 1145.



There are two potential meanings for this surname, the first referring the the Sicilian nickname chiricopu, from the Latin praecoquus meaning “chief cook”. The second relates to the Siculo-Greek personal name Procopiu, from the Greek prokope meaning “fortune, prosperity”.



The argent (silver/white) pigeon or dove and field are both symbols of chivalry, purity, wealth and wisdom. The mullet of six points epitomises merit and honour.
