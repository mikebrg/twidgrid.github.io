Ludwig Galea is a Maltese singer who performed in the Eurovision Song Contest in Istanbul, Turkey, in May 2004. As one half of the duo 'Julie and Ludwig', he and his partner, Julie Zahra, qualified to the final and came 12th out of 36 countries competing. Their song, 'On Again... Off Again,' recorded in Germany, was just in the top 12, so Malta were automatically qualified for the 2005 contest in Kiev, Ukraine in May 2005.
