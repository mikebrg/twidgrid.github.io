Mdina, Saint Paul

For hundreds of years the Cathedral of Mdina was the only parish in Malta, together with the small church that was in Birgu. The building was built during the Norman era and, before it was heavily damaged by the earthquake of 11 January 1693, there was already the thought of rebuilding it. As it is today it is a work of Lorenzo Gafà.
