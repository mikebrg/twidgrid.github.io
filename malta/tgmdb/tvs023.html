This Maltese classic recounts the story of Karmnu ta’ Randu, a farmer, who was a fanatic of the local feast at a village named Hal-Mirdum. He was highly renowned and respected by all. He was the main organiser behind all the preparations for the traditional feast every summer, putting up the decorations in the village streets, inside the church and also being one of the statue bearers during the procession.
