" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The Catholic Charismatic Renewal in Malta made a step forward in May 1975 after a talk by the Australian Mr. Brian Smith at the Catholic Institute. This experience of newness and freshness brought about by Spirit-filled prayers, spread around like wild fire and within a few months most parishes had their own prayer group. Today there are about 70 groups or communities that meet regularly in different parishes around Malta, although these do not necessarily belong within the pastoral dimension of the particular parish.
