Dating back to the early fifteenth century with the likes of  Ramundu Zamit being listed on the Militia Roster in 1417.



Most sources indicate that this surname derives from the Siculo-Arabic zimjât, or zammit which refers to ‘a stern and dignified man’, or ‘a man of high stature’. A weaker proposition suggest that the meaning is far more literal and refers to ‘one who holds another’s hand’.



The sword signifies military strength and freedom whilst the two hands holding it signify leadership. The three stars represent the Catholic faith.
