First recorded in Malta on the Militia List of 1419, Camilleri, competes with Borg for the title of the most common surname on the Maltese Islands.



Likely derived from the Arabic qamillari, which gave us kamelarios (Greek), camellierre (Italian) and camellero (Spanish), all referring to a 'camel driver'. Camillero, on the other hand, is Spanish for 'stretcher bearer'. Other potential origins include the Latin gemahl, meaning 'marriage, partnership'.



Whilst rarely featured in heraldry, camels signify temperance, patience and perseverance.
