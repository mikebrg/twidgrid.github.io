The Local Council of Għargħur represents one of Malta's smallest but culturally rich villages, known for its historic charm and scenic landscapes. Located in the Northern Region, Għargħur is perched on a hill, providing panoramic views of the surrounding countryside and coastlines. The council oversees community services and maintains public spaces, preserving the village’s traditional architecture and heritage sites, such as the Chapel of St. John the Evangelist and the quaint narrow streets of the old town center. Community events, often centered around religious and cultural celebrations, highlight Għargħur's close-knit atmosphere and reflect the island's vibrant customs and local identity.
