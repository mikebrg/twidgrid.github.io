Karl, a free-spirited Gozitan artist who returns to Malta after many years abroad seeking a connection to his roots. Through childhood friends and old haunts, shared memories and a former love, he realises he is no longer the person he once was and wonders whether he can truly return to the place he once called home. Then Karl meets Anna, an unfamiliar face in a familiar land and a new bond is forged. Their friendship gives Karl the freedom to see both Malta and himself from a fresh perspective with renewed hope, and a possible future begins to unfold.
