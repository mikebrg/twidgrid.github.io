Dating back to at least 1417, in 1753, Antonio Azzopardi was made Baron of Marsa by Grand Master Pinto.



This could be derived from the Italian names Azzo or Atzo meaning "noble" (from the Germanic atha, much like Attard), and Pardo (from bardo) meaning "axe" or "beard". Alternatively, it may refer to a Jewish person of Sephardic lineage (asefardi in Hebrew).



Leopards, like lions, are symbols of courage and bravery, but whilst it’s common to see a solitary lion on a coat of arms, it is very rare to see less than two leopards on a crest.
