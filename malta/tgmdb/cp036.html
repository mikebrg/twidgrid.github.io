Mellieħa is one of the ten parishes mentioned in a document from the year 1436, but it ceased to be a parish when it was vacated by the people because of the fear of pirates. But the devotion to the sanctuary of Our Lady, the oldest one in our country, did not end. Mellieħa became a parish again in 1844 and on 5 September 1883 the first stone of the new Church was blessed by the priest Fr Franġisk Mallia Magri. The Church was blessed by Bishop Pietru Pace on 5 September 1897. It was consecrated by Bishop Mawru Caruana on 18 February 1930.
