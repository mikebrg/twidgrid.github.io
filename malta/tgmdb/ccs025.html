The Brothers of the Christian Schools came to Malta in August 1903.  But it was on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, 8 December 1903 that the first school was opened at a house called Villa Schinas, on Rudolph Street in Sliema.  The Brothers called the new school Stella Maris parish church.  Lessons started on 15th September 1904, with seven Brothers.
