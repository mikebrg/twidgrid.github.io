Prior to 1487 a Church dedicated to Our Saviour was built on the Rinella peninsula. Pastoral visits reveal the command by Grand Master Jean Parisot de La Valette for its demolition during the Great Siege of 1565 so as not to serve as shield for the Ottoman army. In 1580 the Church was rebuilt by Claudio Abela and Davidde Burlò. In 1676 Bailiff Fra Giovanni Bichi, victim of the plague, was buried inside it. Hence, in 1680 his nephew Fra Mario Bichi demolished and rebuilt this Church on Lorenzo Gafà’s design.
