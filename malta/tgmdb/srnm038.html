Listed as Chetucuti, Chatucuti, Catcuti and Keticuti amongst others, this surname can be found on the Militia Roster of 1417.



As suggested in the coat of arms itself, this surname most likely derives from the Arabic nickname katkût, meaning “newly hatched chicken”, and may refer to a chicken farmer. There is also a now obsolete Maltese term ketkuti, which refers to someone who “cackles or laughs up one’s sleeve”.



This shield is dominated by two tinctures (colours). Or (gold/yellow) symbolises nobility, virtue, and grandeur, whilst azure (blue) is associated with loyalty, fidelity, and honesty.
