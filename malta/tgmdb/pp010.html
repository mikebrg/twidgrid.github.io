Communist Party of Malta (Maltese: Partit Komunista Malti) is a communist party in Malta. PKM was founded in 1969 at a secret congress in the town of Gwardamangia, following the departure from the Malta Labour Party of a group of left-wing militants that had been active in the struggle for national independence. Anthony Vassallo was the founding general secretary of the party. The party first contested the national general elections of 1987 when it obtained 0.1% of first preference votes and no parliamentary seats. Since then it has not stood for any other election whether at a European, national or local level.
