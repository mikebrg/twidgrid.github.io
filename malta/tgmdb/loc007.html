Dingli (Maltese: Ħad-Dingli) is a village in the Northern Region of Malta, with a population of 3,865 as of 2021. It is 13 kilometres (8 miles) from the capital Valletta and two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the nearest town, Rabat. The village lies on a plateau some 230 metres above sea level, near the highest point of Malta. The area provides not only open sea views over the tiny, uninhabited isle of Filfla, but is also a good vantage point over Malta. From the cliffs there are also views of the nearby Buskett Gardens and Verdala Palace. The Cliffs were also the site of the mysterious death of Mike Mansholt.
