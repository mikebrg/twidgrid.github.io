Oratory Youths Football Club is a football club from the Maltese Isle of Gozo, from the capital of Victoria. The club, previously called the Salesian Youths, was founded in 1946, in relation to the Roman Catholic religious order Salesians of Don Bosco. The club was then renamed Oratory Youths but between the years 1978 and 1989 the club changed its name to Calypsian Bosco Youths before returning to the former and current name Oratory Youths. The club has won the Gozo Football League top division six times.
