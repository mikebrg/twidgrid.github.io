Birgu Local Council
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The Local Council of Birgu, also known as Vittoriosa, represents one of Malta’s most historic cities. Birgu is a fortified city in the Grand Harbour area, known for its strategic importance and deep-rooted history dating back to the Middle Ages. The Local Council is responsible for the upkeep of the city’s rich cultural heritage, which includes landmarks like the Inquisitor's Palace and Fort St. Angelo, as well as its quaint, narrow streets lined with traditional Maltese architecture. The council organizes local events, manages municipal services, and promotes Birgu’s cultural assets, particularly through the annual Birgufest, which draws both locals and tourists to enjoy the city’s charm under candlelit ambiance. Through these efforts, the Birgu Local Council plays a vital role in preserving and celebrating the city’s legacy as a cornerstone of Maltese heritage.
