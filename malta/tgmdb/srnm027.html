Dating back to at least the early fifteenth century we find, amongst others, Antoni Cakie listed on the Militia Roster of 1417.



It is possibly the feminine of Cauchi, or of Gauci, and may well reference Għawdxija, the feminine form of 'Gozitan'. Alternatively, it may come from the Italian nickname kaukes or kakos which are derived from the Greek words for 'bad, evil' or 'spiteful person'.



The Gozitan connection may explain the three hills on this coat of arms, which also symbolise safety and protection. Comets are generally associated with hope and prophecy. Here they almost certainly imply the holy trinity as well.
