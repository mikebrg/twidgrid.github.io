Whilst it is likely this surname was established in Malta in medieval times, it was most likely confined to Gozo. Its first appearance is on the Crociata Records of Gozo in 1533.



Of Siculo-Arabic origin, it may relate to Marseca, a subregion of Abruzzo in Italy, which may refer to the Arabic rashaq meaning "to throw a missile".



Also from Arabic, merxiqa refers to a length of wood used in grocery stores to remove excess from a measure, whilst the Italian merciaio keeps with this theme and refers to a "merchant, hawker, peddler".
