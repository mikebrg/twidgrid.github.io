First listed in the Militia Roster of 1419, Dimech has multiple potential sources. The most likely origin is from the Italian name Domenico, or its French variant Domenech, both derive from the Latin name Dominicus, meaning 'of the Lord'.



It could also derive from the Italian surname Dimecca, meaning “of Mecca” and refers to someone from that holy city. It should also be noted that dimeg means “mind” in Arabic.



Reclining maidens in heraldry are symbols of innocence and purity. The three mullets of six points represent the family's Christian faith.
