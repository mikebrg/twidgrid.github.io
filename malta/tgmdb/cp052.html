When the areas between Birkirkara and Sliema, after the Second World War, began to develop, the Archbishop Mons. Mikiel Gonzi asked the Capuchin monks to take care of the spiritual life of the people. The Capuchins began their work in 1956 and thought of building a church dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes which was completed in 1959. In 1965 it became a local parish church.
