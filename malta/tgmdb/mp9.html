He spoke about how much his Catholic faith had driven him to be active in politics ... that in man you cannot separate what you believe politically from what you practice. He was a political member who lived his Catholic faith.<p>He himself used to say that at that time, when he was active in the Christian Workers Party, it was a sad period in political history because many of the debates in Parliament would end in attacks on one another due to the religious political issue.<p>He served until 15 February 1966 when parliament was dissolved.<p>He was also vice-president of the Christian Workers Party, president of the Young Christian Workers, Paola, national president of the Adult Section of the Young Christian Workers, a member of the General Council of the General Workers Union, a member of the Industrial Council and co-founder of the Richmond Foundation.<p>A man of principle, who would not bend principles for nothing, he died on 1 November 2011.
