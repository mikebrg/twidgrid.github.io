St. Nicholas Bay is a beautiful beach located in Comino, Malta. It’s known for its clear azure waters and picturesque views. The bay consists of two small sandy beaches. These beaches may be reserved for the Comino Hotel guests in summer, but it’s worth having a swim at due to its stunning, family-friendly waters.
