In the 1930s, Waterpolo enthusiasts, including Tony Sant Cassia, Salvatore Cassar, and the Catania brothers, formed a team in St. Paul’s Bay called SIRENS. The club’s early years involved matches against the Royal Navy and a merger with Sea Lions. In 1959, SIRENS won its first division league title, achieving a memorable hattrick by retaining it for three seasons. Success continued, with notable achievements in the 1960s and 1970s.
