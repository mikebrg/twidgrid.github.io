Laura Vicuna School as it is known today was primarily a convent for the Salesian nuns known as the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians.  The School first opened its doors to students in October 1970 when it was decided by the Gozo Salesian nuns that part of the convent would be used as a school.  Consecutively a class was added each year until 1978 when the school started offering classes from Kindergarten to Year 6.  Since then the Gozo Salesian community has been educating children from all over Gozo.
