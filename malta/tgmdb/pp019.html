Għarb First (Maltese: Għarb l-Ewwel), is a localist party located in and operating only in Għarb village, Gozo (Republic of Malta). It was founded by former PN Mayor David Apap to contest the 2019 Maltese local elections. It gained 2 seats out of the 5 total seats in the Għarb Local Council, and 42.86% of the popular vote, narrowly losing the popular vote to PL by 1.95%, or 19 votes. This makes Għarb l-Ewwel the first third party to gain representation in the local level in both the Republic of Malta at-large and on the island of Gozo. This also makes David Apap the only mayor of a village that comes from a third party. This was confirmed after a question on who the Mayorship of the Council was solved after the election.
