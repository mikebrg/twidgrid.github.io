The Chapel of St Nicholas (Maltese: Kappella ta' San Nikola) is a Roman Catholic chapel located in Fort Ricasoli in Kalkara, Malta. It was built between 1696 and 1698 as a parish church for the fort's garrison, and it was dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Bari. The chapel remained in use until the fort was decommissioned in the 1960s, and it fell into a state of disrepair. Currently there are plans to restore the chapel along with the rest of the fort.
