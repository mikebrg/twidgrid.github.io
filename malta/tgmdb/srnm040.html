In the form of Chantar, this surname was first documented in 1419. However, as noted below, its roots may go back significantly further.



It bears a strong resemblance to the Sicilian occupational surname Cianta, itself from the word ciantiari, meaning  “joker”. It may also come from the Italian surname Cantore, which was recorded in Malta in 1274 and could refer to a singer.



Lions or leopards rampant with trees are often featured in Maltese heraldry (Mifsud, Azzopardi and Saliba), the former signifies courage, determination and leadership, whilst the latter represents strength.
