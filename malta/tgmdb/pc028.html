The Parish Church of Saint Mary (Maltese: Il-Knisja ta' Santa Marija) is a Roman Catholic parish church in Attard, Malta, dedicated to the Assumption of Mary. Built between 1613 and 1624, the church is attributed to the architect Tommaso Dingli and it is regarded as the finest Renaissance church in Malta. It still retains its original design, with the exception of a belfry and two sacristies which were added in the 18th and 19th centuries.
