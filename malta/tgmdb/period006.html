Between 1939 and 1945, Malta played a crucial role in World War II as a British stronghold in the Mediterranean. The island endured heavy bombardment from Axis forces, with the Italian and German air forces targeting Malta’s strategic ports and airfields. Despite the constant attacks, the resilience of the Maltese people and British military personnel earned the island the George Cross for bravery in 1942. Malta's position made it a key base for launching Allied operations, particularly in the North African campaign, and its defense was vital to the success of the Allies in the Mediterranean theater.
