Although Msgr. Dusina, in the report of his pastoral visit in 1575 left written that Mosta was a parish, in fact it became a parish in 1608 and the people of the village immediately started thinking about building a new church on the plan by Tumas Dingli. This church was demolished to build the church that is there today based on a design by the Architect George Grognet de Vasse.
