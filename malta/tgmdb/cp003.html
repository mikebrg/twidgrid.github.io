In St Julian's, in Balluta bay, since 1859, there was a church dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel that was built by the Mount Carmel Brotherhood of Valletta. In 1877 the church was rebuilt and given to the Carmelite monks who rebuilt it in 1900. In 1958 it was rebuilt and in 1974 it became a parish.
