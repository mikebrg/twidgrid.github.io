Dating back to 1417 and potentially the Italo-Greek name Schembari (itself from the Greek name Skèmpres) a noble family with grounds near the city of Messina, Sicily.



It could also be connected to Sigambri, a Latin name given to a germanic tribe. However, evidence also shows that this surname may derive from the Arabic name Schamber.



In heraldry, it is represented by a deer atop a tower, the former reflects nobility whilst the latter represents strength.
