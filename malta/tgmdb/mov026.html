Robert returns to Malta from Australia for his aunt's funeral. In the meantime, he also comes to look for the one he loved 25 years ago, but all will be in vain because he finds out that she died. From now onward he could not cancel the past he had with his loved one Joyce. Meanwhile John comprehends Robert's return and orders his friend Jim to tail him. What happened 25 years ago between Robert and John? How is Robert going to free himself from John's fieriness when even his nickname THE EXECUTIONER (IL-BOJJA) terrifies.
