Birgu is considered the oldest parish after the Cathedral. When the Knights came, the church of Saint Lawrence became the Conventual Church of the Order, while the church of the Annunciation from 1530 to 1571 served as a Parish Church. The church that is there today was built between 1681 and 1697 by Lorenzo Gafà and became a Collegiate Church in 1820.
