The Old Motors Club of Malta (OMC) was formed in October 1989. It is an offshoot of the former Collectors' Vehicles Club (CVC), which also catered for vintage motorcycles and military vehicles. Today, there are three clubs: the Old Motors Club, the Historic Motorcycle Club (HMC), and the Military Vehicles Collectors Club (MVCC). Together, they form the FMVA (Federazzjoni Maltija Vetturi Antiki) but are autonomous from each other. The OMC is today the most significant vintage and classic car club in Malta, with some 300 local and overseas members and close to 1,000 cars. The oldest car in the club is a 1904 Cadillac, one of the first to come to Malta. The OMC accepts all cars on a 25-year rolling basis.
