Most of the fishermen that operated from the village of Xlendi lived in Fontana. Late in the nineteenth century, they began setting aside part of the proceeds from their catches to raise a church. The foundation stone of the church was laid on 29 January 1892 and it was dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus in 1905. It was consecrated thirteen years to that day on 29 January 1905. The church was established parish of Fontana on 27 March 1911 during the bishopric of Giovanni Maria Camilleri.
