Sliema, Virgin Mary Star of the Sea
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
Sliema started to become a resort for the people of Valletta in the middle of the nineteenth century and at first, the small church dedicated to Our Lady of Grace (completed in 1804), was enough for the people who lived there. But when the population increased, the need to build another church was felt. This was done in 1854 and the church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary Star of the Sea. Later the church was enlarged and in 1878 it became a parish. Sliema continued to grow and other parishes such as Sacro Cuor, Saint Gregory and Jesus of Nazareth were added.
