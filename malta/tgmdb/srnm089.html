The oldest known recording of this surname relates to a Vincenza Polidano, born in Vittoriosa in 1577.



It most likely originates from the Italian Surname Politano, itself from the Greek Polites, meaning “a native or citizen of Constantinople”.



The abundance of Argent (silver/white) on this shield, indicates purity, innocence, sincerity, and peace, with the azur (blue) chief referencing loyalty and perseverance. Crosses, symbols of sacredness and victory, are generally used as ordinaries, but here we see it embedded into the chief, looked over by a sun in splendour.
