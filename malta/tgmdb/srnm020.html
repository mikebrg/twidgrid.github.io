We first see this surname documented in Malta in the Militia Roster in 1417.



An Arabic surname connected to the Algerian city of Bejaia (Bougia in Italian), renowned for the manufacture of wax candles (bougies). It could also come from the Sicilian name Bug(g)ea, (probably from the Greek boukaios meaning "cowherd, herdsmen"), or the Sicilian word bbuggia, meaning a "hunter's bag".



Calves in heraldry are a symbol of generosity, strength and power. It is shown in argent (white/silver) representing chivalry, purity, wealth and wisdom, which is further amplified by the argent field.
