The earliest known documentation of this surname lists a Martinus and Leo Calleya in 1276.



A surname of Siculo-Greek descent, it most likely originates from kalleyias, meaning 'farmer' in Greek, or from kallas, for 'good, gracious, handsome', also in Greek. It may also derive from the Spanish calle, meaning 'country lane, alley-way'.



The Eagle is a symbol of intelligence and a person of action, whilst the argent (white) field refers to innocence, sincerity, peace and joy. The motto on this coat of arms is in Latin and states 'The royal bird adorns me'.
