First recorded in Malta in the 1417 Militia Roster with a presence in Sicily dating back to the late twelfth century.



This surname is most likely connected with the sacred Muslim city of Qayrawân in Tunisia, with al-karawani referring to a 'native or immigrant' from this city. Alternatively, it could originate from the Siculo-Arabic caruana, meaning 'a group of people or workers' or the Arabic kârwân, meaning 'a caravan of camels, horses and donkeys'.



The symbol of the cross on an azure (blue) chief indicates that the family is Christian while the flames represent purity.
