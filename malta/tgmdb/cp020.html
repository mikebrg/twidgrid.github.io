On the 10th of July 1902, some drunken sailors threw a stone at a niche of Our Lady of Mount Carmel that was against the wall of a house in front of the Gzira bridge and the stone remained attached to the glass of the frame. This led to a small chapel being built a short distance away and it became known as the chapel of Our Lady of the Stone. This chapel became a parish in 1921 and the local people began to strive to build a bigger church, dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The building was built between 1921 and 1935, and was consecrated on 23 May 1959.
