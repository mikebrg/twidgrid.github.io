Arab Period

Between 870 and 1091, Malta experienced the Arab Period, marking a significant chapter in its history. Following the Aghlabid conquest, the islands became part of the Islamic world, introducing new cultural and agricultural practices. The Arab influence reshaped Malta's language, architecture, and irrigation systems, many of which laid the foundation for future developments. While the islands were likely sparsely populated during this period, the Arabs fortified key areas and integrated Malta into their trade networks. This era came to an end in 1091 with the Norman invasion led by Roger I, ushering in a new phase of Maltese history.
