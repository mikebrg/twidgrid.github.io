The village of Balzan became a parish on 14 August 1655, and the old church of the Annunciation became the parish church. Fourteen years later, in December 1669, the construction of today's church began and continued until 1695. Four years after the laying of the first stone, the church aisle was completed and began to serve as a parish church.
