The heir apparent of the fief was Guglielmo de Malta, nephew of Count Andreolo. Guglielmo died in 1299, leaving all possessions to his daughter Lukina. It appears that during the period between 1300 and 1320, no Count of Malta held the fief. Lukina held on to the rights she had inherited from her father, without actually holding any title or power. The most important positions were filled by natives and people appointed by the Crown.
