A drama with dark comic moments and a gay subtext: Three room-mates, running away from life, meet a disabled gay author, who forces them to rediscover themselves and those around them. Genesis unfolds over seven days, and humbly tries to test the development of relationships between people of different cultures and sexual orientations.
