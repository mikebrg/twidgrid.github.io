The people of Mġarr, because of the distance they had to the church, had long wanted the small church of Santa Marija they had in the village to become a parish. Their wish came true in 1898 and they immediately started thinking about building a new church. With the work and effort of all the people of the village, the church was completed in the year 1946.
