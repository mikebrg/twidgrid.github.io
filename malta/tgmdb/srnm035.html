Also common in the Levant, the surname in this form was first recorded in the Militia Roster of 1419.



From the Siculo-Arabic al-kassâr, meaning 'stone-cutter' or 'fuller of cloth or newly shorn wool'. It may also relate to the Arabic qasr and kassâr (from which we get the Spanish Alcazar) or the Latin castrum, all of which refer to 'castles' or 'a castellan'.



This coat of arms features a cross formy (with the ends of its limbs flattened) in gules (red) symbolising military victory, warrior spirit and majesty. It is surrounded by Latin word SPES, meaning 'hope'.
