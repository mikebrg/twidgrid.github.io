Whilst found in the Militia Roster of 1417, there is an earlier record of a Paulinus De Lia from 1360.



Whilst many will assume this surname derives from the Maltese dielja, meaning 'vine', it is far more likely to derive from Dèlia, a name given to communes near in Sicily, named after vineyards (dâlya in Arabic). More likely still, it is a truncated form of the patronymic surname De Elia or De Lia, referring to descendants of a person named Elia or Lia. 



Grapes in heraldry are symbols of agriculture and husbandry as well as nobility and aristocracy. An or (gold/yellow) field means majesty, success, respect and virtue.
