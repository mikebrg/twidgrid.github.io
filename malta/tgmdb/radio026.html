The purpose for which the Xewkija Community Radio was founded is to convey the spirit of the village feast to those who cannot join their fellow Xewkin in the other functions and activities, which take place in the week of the feast. The main goal was that both the sick and the elderly, as well as those who take care of them, do not feel alone in these days of joy when the village is celebrating the feast. Emigrants were also given importance. In fact, from the second schedule Radio Prekursur had, between May 26 and June 24, 1998, Radio Prekursur thought of dedicating a special program during which a direct connection was made with the emigrants who were celebrating the party in Melbourne in Australia. This appointment is still held every year, on the eve of the festival at around 1.00 p.m. This was not the only appointment with the emigrants. In fact, every year several emigrants contact us, both through phone calls and even through email to convey their congratulations to their relatives who live in Gozo. Radio Prekursur started with its broadcasts on the internet during the festive schedule of the year 1999 (Radio Prekursur had a schedule of programs between 30 May and 28 June 1999).
