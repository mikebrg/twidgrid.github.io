Malta Classic

The Malta Classic has its origins in October 2007, when French entrepreneur and classic car enthusiast Thierry Giovannoni organised Malta’s first ever Classic Car Grand Prix on the ring road of Valletta, bringing some of Europe’s finest classic cars to Malta to tour the island and race wheel to wheel on the Valletta circuit. In April 2009 enthusiasts brought together by this event set up the Valletta Grand Prix Foundation to carry on what Giovannoni had started. In 2011 the Malta Classic was transferred to its current home in Mdina, where it celebrates vintage style and speed against an historic backdrop.
