The Chapel of St Anne (Maltese: Kappella ta' Sant'Anna) is a Roman Catholic chapel in Fort St Angelo in Birgu, Malta. Its existence was first documented in the 13th century, and according to tradition it stands on the site of an ancient temple. The present building was constructed around 1430 and it was enlarged in 1532 by the Order of St John. The building ceased to function as a chapel in 1798, and it was used as a store, as a school and as a Church of England chapel before being converted back to a Catholic chapel in the mid-20th century. It has been restored and it is now managed by the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
