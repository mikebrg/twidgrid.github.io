We first see this surname documented in Malta in the Militia Roster of 1417.



Most likely of Italian origin (an apocopated form of the surname Parnisi) but relates to the Yiddish parnes. which refers to a leader of an Ashkenazi Jew community.



Whilst the term rampant is usually used in heraldry to describe animals rearing up, this is used exclusively for carnivorous quadrupeds, with the term forcené used for horses and unicorns. Horses represent good values and worthiness.
