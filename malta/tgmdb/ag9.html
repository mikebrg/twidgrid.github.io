Basic info & role<p>Dr. Michele Tufigno was Crown Advocate General of Malta from 1965 to 1971. <p>The title “Crown Advocate General” was the name used then, before being changed back to “Attorney General.” <p>His responsibilities would have included advising the government on legal matters and overseeing prosecutions, both criminal and civil (as was the norm at that time). <p>Context & timeline<p>In 1964, the independence of Malta led to constitutional provisions that embedded the Attorney General’s office’s political independence: in particular, that the Attorney General could institute, undertake and also discontinue criminal proceedings and was not subject to direction or control by any other person or authority. <p>Also, in 1965, by Legal Notice 46, the designation Attorney General was changed to Crown Advocate General; Dr. Tufigno served under this title. <p>Then in 1971, the title Crown Advocate General was re-aligned (or re-titled) again as Attorney General. <p>Personal & legacy notes<p>Dr. Tufigno’s term (1965–1971) sits at a historically significant period: after independence (1964) and before Malta’s later constitutional and legal evolutions. <p>He was succeeded (in the Crown Advocate General / Attorney General role) by Dr. Edgar Mizzi, who served from 1971–1981.
