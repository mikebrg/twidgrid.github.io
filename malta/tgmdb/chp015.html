The Chapel of the Immaculate Conception is a Roman Catholic church in Bengħisa near the town of Birżebbuġa in the Southern Region of Malta. The church was built in 1822 for the use of local farmers by Rev. Ġakbu Gauci. The mason Francis Callus was the builder of the church. Between 1861 and 1862 the church was extensively rebuilt and extended by Rev. Ġuzepp Gauci, the nephew of founder Rev. Ġakbu Gauci. The chapel was consecrated by Gaetano Pace Forno in 1862. It is listed Grade 2 on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.
