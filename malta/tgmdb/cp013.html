Fgura, Our Lady of Mount Carmel
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
For hundreds of years in Fgura there was a niche of Our Lady and next to it in 1798 a small chapel was built, which was rebuilt in 1844. This church was demolished by the Government in 1956 to be able to widen the road that takes you from Paola to Zabbar. A little far from where the church was, the Carmelite Friars in 1950 built another church which in 1965 became a parish church. After Fgura became a parish, the population continued to grow and the need for a bigger church was felt. Therefore the present church was built which is located in Triq Hompesch. It was blessed on 25 May 1988 and was consecrated by Mons. Archbishop Joseph Mercieca on 1 February 1990.
