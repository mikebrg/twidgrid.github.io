The Parish Church and Sanctuary of Our Lady of Graces (Maltese: Knisja Arċipretali u Santwarju tal-Madonna tal-Grazzja) is a Roman Catholic parish church in Żabbar, Malta, dedicated to Our Lady of Graces. The church was originally built between 1641 and 1696 to designs of the Renaissance architect Tommaso Dingli. Its façade, an outstanding example of Maltese Baroque architecture, was built in 1738 to designs of Giovanni Bonavia. The dome was rebuilt in the early 19th century after it had been damaged during the French blockade of 1798-1800, and it was rebuilt again in the first half of the 20th century to designs of Giuseppe Pace.
