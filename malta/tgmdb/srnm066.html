One of the first documented occurrences of this surname lists Pietro Galea, an Aragonese soldier who settled in Malta around 1370.



Most likely of Italian origin, it could refer to the medieval Greek galaia meaning "galley" or the Latin galea, meaning "helmet". Both would likely refer to a person’s occupation, such as a sailor, shipbuilder, soldier, or armourer.



It could also be connected to the Spanish name Galià, meaning "Gaul" or "someone originating from France".
