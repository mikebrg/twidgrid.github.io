Consistently one of the most widely found surnames in Malta, Borg was recorded as the most common surname on the islands from as early as 1687.



Most likely deriving from the Arabic burdj, meaning "heap of stones", and, by extension, "tower" or "fortress". Similarities can be found in many European languages, such as the Italian borgo and the Greek purgos, referring to a "walled city".



Towers in heraldry signify strength and vigilance, when placed atop a mount they further imply security and protection.
