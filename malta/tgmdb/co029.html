The Theology Students’ Association (T.S.A.) was founded on the 6th of November 1945 under the name of Royal University Students’ Theology Association. The present name was adopted in 1978 after the Faculty of Theology ceased to form part of the University, because of the reforms then introduced. The Faculty of Theology again became part of the University of Malta in 1988. During the period in which the Theology students were not at the University, the T.S.A. continually spoke out in favour of the return of the Faculty of Theology to the University, where it is today.
