Also commonly listed as Xerri, We find this surname already documented in the Militia Roster of 1419.



Most likely related to the Sicilian nickname Scerra, itself from sciarra, which means ‘brawl, dispute’. Arabic roots include sharra meaning ‘bad, wicked’, shirrii meaning ‘clandestine’ shirra meaning ‘anger’, or sharrî meaning ‘bold, impetuous’ — All refer to someone who is up for a fight.



The serrated 'bendy' field, traditionally associated with a continued family lineage, maybe a nod to the Maltese 'serrieq', meaning “saw”. The or field represents success.
