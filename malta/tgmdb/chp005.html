The present church dedicated to the Holy Trinity was built on the site of a medieval church dedicated to Our Lady of Monserrat, another Catalan influence. The original church dates back to the second half of the 15th century. When the church was visited by Mons Dusina in 1575, he reported that it needed to be better taken care of, as it had some structural damages. From the report of this visit it is known that the church used to face the Birgu Marina. It was in 1658 that the church was re-dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Up until the eve of the Second World War, the church was still in use and frequented by the locals. Unfortunately, it was destroyed during the war and eventually rebuilt​.
