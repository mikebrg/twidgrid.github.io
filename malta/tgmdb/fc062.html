Valletta F.C. is a football club based in Valletta, the capital city of Malta. They compete in the Maltese Challenge League, the Maltese second division, following relegation from the Maltese Premier League in 2024. The club was founded in 1943 after a merge of Valletta Prestons, Valletta St. Paul's and Valletta United, the latter being a two-time league winner before the Second World War.
