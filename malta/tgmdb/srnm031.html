FIrst recorded in Malta in the late fifteenth century though its connections within Sicily as Carabotto date back further.



Its Sicilian origins could be tied to the Greek karabiotes meaning sailor. The Latin carabus refers to a type of boat, further connecting this surname to the maritime profession.



Perhaps unsurprisingly, this coat of arms features a boat upon which we find an eagle, representing boldness and a person of action, in sable (black). The three mullets of six points are a symbol of the Christian faith.
