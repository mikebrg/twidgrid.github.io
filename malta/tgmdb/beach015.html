Għajn Tuffieħa is a bay and sandy, red beach which is located in Mġarr, Malta. The bay is 345 metres (377 yd) south of Golden Bay. It is quieter than Golden Bay and often visited by Maltese natives themselves as well as tourist visitors. To reach this beach, one needs to descend a hill on a staircase of 200 steps. On top of the cliffs west of Għajn Tuffieħa bay, there is an old defense tower built in 1637. It is one of the seven towers built by Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris, of the Knights Hospitaller.
