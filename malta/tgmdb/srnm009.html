This surname dates back to at least the early fifteenth century, along with Baldaquinus, Baldachinus and Baldakin(u), we find it on the Militia Roster in 1417.



In Italian, a baldacchino can refer to a "canopy that is carried", usually used in religious ceremonies (a baldachin in English or baldakkin in Maltese), as well as a luxurious silk fabric that originated from Baghdad.



This coat of arms features a canopy held by a dexter arm, atop an argent (white, silver) brick wall signifying spiritual strength.
