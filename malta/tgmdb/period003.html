Labour Governments
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
Between 1971 and 1987, Malta underwent significant socio-political changes under the Labour governments led by Dom Mintoff and later Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici. Dom Mintoff's administration (1971-1984) focused on reducing Malta's reliance on foreign powers, renegotiating military agreements with Britain, and fostering closer ties with non-aligned nations. His government also prioritized social reforms, introducing free education, healthcare, and pensions. However, this era was marked by political tension and economic challenges. Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici succeeded Mintoff in 1984, continuing Labour's policies but facing increasing domestic unrest. This period saw significant strides toward modernizing Malta, despite the controversies and polarized political climate.
