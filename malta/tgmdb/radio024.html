Radio Margerita started broadcasting in July 2000 for the occasion of the feast of Santa Margerita, which is celebrated every year on the last Sunday of July in Ta' Sannat. The purpose of the station is entertainment, information and above all to educate all those, especially the Sannatin who follow us on FM 96.1MHz or on our streaming website at www.sannatparish.com. We greatly appreciate your response, with comments and suggestions. Best wishes for good listening.
