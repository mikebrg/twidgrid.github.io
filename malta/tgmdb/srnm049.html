As Dallo and Dallu(s) we first see this surname in the Militia Roster of 1419.



Deriving either from the Italian surname Dallo, itself deriving from the Germanic dal, meaning “dale, valley”, or from the Siculo-Arabic dalli, meaning “erroneous, faulty”, and most likely referred to “someone who has gone astray”.



The lions rampant, symbols of courage and bravery, are shown in sable (black), a symbol of constancy, prudence, and intelligence, protecting an argent (silver/white) fort with a gules (red) pennant, most likely referring to a bastion of purity and piety.
