Louis the Child (Italian: Ludovico or Luigi; 4 February 1338 - 16 October 1355) was King of Sicily (also known as 'Trinacria') from 15 September 1342 until his death. He was a minor upon his succession, and was under a regency until 1354. His actual rule was short, for he died in an outbreak of plague the next year. His reign was marked by civil war.
