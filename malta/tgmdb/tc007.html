In the beginning of 1990 Dr Anton Mifsud Bonnici approached Mr Henry Borg (former Club President) and expressed his idea that a Tennis Club should be founded in the Cottonera area. He proposed that the Old Navy Wireless and Telegraphy station at Rinella in Kalkara would be an ideal place considering that there already existed a tennis court and some adjacent buildings which could be used as club premises. Mr Borg agreed that it was worth visiting the place and considering this idea seriously.
