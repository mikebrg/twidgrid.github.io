St Francis School Cospicua is one of the four primary schools on the islands belonging to the Franciscan Sisters of the Heart of Jesus.  It is a co-ed, mixed-ability primary school that grounds its education on Christian values, the charism of our Foundress the Venerable Mother Margherita De Brincat and on the mandated National Curriculum Framework, Learning Outcomes Framework and policies. It aims at providing holistic education in a value-rich environment, transforming students into true Christians and enabling them to master academic and 21st-century competencies.
