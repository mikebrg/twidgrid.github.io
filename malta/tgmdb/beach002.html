Armier Bay (in Maltese: Bajjet l-Armier), is situated in the locality of Mellieħa, Malta. Armier Bay consists of two beaches, the biggest beach is known as Armier and the other one as Little Armier. The sea of this bay is crystal blue, like the water of the Blue Lagoon. This is because it is situated exactly in the opposite direction of Comino, like Ħondoq ir-Rummien in Gozo, and so this makes it the most crystal blue sea on the island of Malta.
