The Young Christian Workers and students are an organised movement of lay people whose aim is to be Christ’s witnesses among their fellow workers and to work hand in hand with the Hierarchy of the Church. The aim of their witness is to obtain for themselves and their fellow workers that freedom which is worthy of man’s dignity as willed by Christ. Through group activities, young workers are trained to give meaning to their lives and to find responsible and just solutions to their problems at local, national and international levels.
