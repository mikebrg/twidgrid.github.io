Elf Metodu is a thirteen-episode TV series that deals with murder in a humorous way. It tells the story of Karen - an unassertive Maltese woman choked in her reality by an abusive husband - and drowned by slanderous conversations with her husband's pet bulldog, Elvis, who goes out of his way to please his master at Karen's expense.
