As Batista/i, Bat(t)istio, and Di Bat(t)ista amongst others, this surname can be found on the Status Animarum of Malta of 1687.



From the Italian name Battista, itself from the Greek baptistes, it is an epithet associated with Saint John the Baptist.



The traditional heraldry for this surname is full of religious features. The lamb is representative of Christ, courage and resolve whilst also definitely providing a nod to Saint John the Baptist in this case. The three mullets of six points are a symbol of the Holy Trinity and the escallop represents pilgrims, piety, victory and warrior spirit.
