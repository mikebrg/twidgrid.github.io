The Mosta Cycling Club was founded on the17th August 1953. These sixty years cannot be narrated in just this page. Eventually in 1981 the first magazine was published covering the visit of Italian team from Cesenatico and the event organised by our club. In 1989 the club published a second magazine covering the major events from 1953 to that date. Again in 1995 a third magazine to commemorate the opening of the club's premises was published covering the period mostly from 1989 to 1995 to commemorate the opening of the club’s premises. In 2003, on the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the club, the fourth detailed magazine covering major issues and achievements of the club year by year since 1953 was published, and included an extensive amount of photographs in colour and monogram. In foresight of any further booklets being published over the years, another notebook of activities from 2003 onwards is being compiled together every two years for any reference of club activities in future.
