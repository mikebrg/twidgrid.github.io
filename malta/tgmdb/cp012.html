Ħal Tartarni, a village that no longer exists today, was a parish in 1436 but when people stopped living there, in 1539 the parish of Ħal Tartarni was dissolved. A short distance away another village was built, Ħad Dingli, and this became a parish in 1615. The church that is there today was built in 1903 instead of the church that was built in 1678.
