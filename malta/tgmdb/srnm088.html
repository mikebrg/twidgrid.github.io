This surname can be found initially in the Militia Roster of 1419.



Italian in origin, from pisano meaning “Pisan, a native of the city of Pisa”. It should be noted that a record of a Pisan visiting Malta in 1184 is the oldest reference to a Latin presence in Malta. Pisa itself most likely derives from the Greek pisos, meaning “irrigated land”.



This coat of arms traditionally incorporates a heraldic dolphin hauriant, a symbol of charity, agility and vigilance. The party per bend dexter (to the right) incorporates 3 mullets of six points referencing loyalty to the Christian faith.
