Bir Miftuh was one of the ten parishes that were here in our country in 1436. The village of Bir Miftuh no longer exists but only the church remains which is now part of the Gudja parish. The parish church of Gudja that is there today was built in 1656 and is dedicated to the Ascension of the Virgin Mary. On 19 July 2006 it was declared an Archpriestly Parish.
