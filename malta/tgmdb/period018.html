Neolithic Period
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
Between 5900 BC and 3850 BC, Malta experienced its Neolithic Period, marked by the arrival of the first settlers from nearby Sicily. These early inhabitants brought with them farming, pottery, and basic tools, transforming the islands into a thriving agrarian society. The Neolithic people of Malta constructed rudimentary shelters and began developing cultural practices that laid the groundwork for the remarkable megalithic temples that would follow. Evidence of their lives is found in ancient pottery fragments and tools, showcasing their resourcefulness and adaptability in a new environment.
