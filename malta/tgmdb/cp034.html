Marsaxlokk, since ancient times, was considered a holy place, as evidenced by the ruins that are in the area of tas-​​Silġ. For a long time, due to the fear of pirates, people stopped living there but around 1890 the place started to attract people again, mostly in the summer, and therefore built a church dedicated to Our Lady of Pompeii which became a parish church in 1897. In the last thirty years, on May 8, the anniversary of the dedication of the Sanctuary of Our Lady in Pompeii near Naples, a national pilgrimage is taking place in the parish. The Parish Church is a Marian Sanctuary.
