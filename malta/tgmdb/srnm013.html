First seen in Malta in the  Militia Roster of 1417, Bezzina has quite a few potential meanings both from the North and South.



If we look towards Italy, it could derive from multiple surnames, such as Bezzi, Beggi, Bizzini, Vizzini or Basilio with the latter, like Psaila, coming from the Greek basileios meaning “royal”. It may also refer to an Arabic nickname composed of (i)bn, meaning “son” and zîna, meaning “ornament, beauty” and refers to a trim and beautiful person.



Doves in Heraldry are a symbol of peace whilst wheat signifies plenty and a hospitable host.
