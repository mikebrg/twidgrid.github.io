The People's Party (Maltese: Partit Popolari, PP), also erroneously called the Popular Party by Maltese English-language media, is a conservative political party in Malta. It was founded in July 2020 and is currently headed by Paul Salomone. The party has never obtained any seats in local councils or the Maltese parliament. It does not contest European elections. It is considered right-wing to far-right by certain journalists and portals, however the party protests against the latter characterisation.
