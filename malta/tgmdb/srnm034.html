An old Maltese surname, one of the earliest recordings of it mentions an Anxonus Casha, of Birgu, in 1399.



Almost certainly of Semitic origin with the most likely source being the Arabic nickname Qasha, meaning “tough, ruthless”. Qas’a, also Arabic, refers to a wooden bowl used to sort fish, perhaps denoting a fishmonger.



Three mullets (stars), referring to the holy trinity, are very common motifs in Maltese heraldry, however, they are usually depicted in the traditional six points and not the more modern five-pointed variants. Towers in heraldry signify strength and vigilance.
