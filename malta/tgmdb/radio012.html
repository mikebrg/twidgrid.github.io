Establishing its presence in the broadcasting landscape, Radio 105, also known as Radio Galaxy, embarked on its journey on December 6, 2001. This milestone was achieved following the issuance of a license by the Broadcasting Authority to Mr. Manuel Chircop. The license specifically authorized community-based broadcasting, designating frequency 105 for Radio 105’s transmissions. Notably, the Malta Communications Authority facilitated this by releasing the same frequency to Mr. Chircop, laying the foundation for a community-centric radio station.
