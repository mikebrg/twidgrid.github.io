"KWIR" is Malta's pioneering LGBTIQ+ television series that premiered on January 6, 2025, exclusively on ONE TV. Created, written, and directed by Brandon Terribile, known for his inclusive and boundary-pushing work, the series offers a fresh narrative focusing on themes of self-discovery, family, and acceptance. The storyline centers on Lysander, a young footballer who begins to explore a romantic connection with another male student, challenging traditional norms in Maltese football culture. The series delves into various aspects of the LGBTIQ+ experience, including pansexuality and non-binary identities, aiming to foster understanding and representation.
