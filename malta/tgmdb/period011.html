Between 1091 and 1530, Malta experienced significant transformation under the Norman Kingdom of Sicily's rule and subsequent dynasties. The Normans, led by Count Roger I, integrated Malta into their realm, ending Arab dominance and bringing the island into the fold of Latin Christendom. Over the centuries, Malta became a strategic stronghold in the Mediterranean, governed by various rulers, including the Swabians, Aragonese, and eventually the Spanish Crown. These influences enriched Malta's culture, architecture, and governance, setting the stage for its pivotal role in European and Mediterranean affairs.
