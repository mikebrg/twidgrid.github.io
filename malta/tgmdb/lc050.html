San Lawrenz Local Council
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The Local Council of San Lawrenz is the governing body for the village of San Lawrenz, located on the island of Gozo, Malta. As one of the smallest localities on the island, it serves the community by addressing local needs and promoting cultural, social, and environmental initiatives. The council works to preserve the village's traditional charm while fostering development and tourism. San Lawrenz is known for its picturesque landscapes, historic sites, and proximity to the famous Azure Window, now obliterated by a storm, a natural limestone arch that drew visitors from around the world.
