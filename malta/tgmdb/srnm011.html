As Barbará, this surname was listed amongst the Aragonese garrison of Ruggerio di Loria which occupied Malta in 1283.



Two popular theories related to this surname state it either derives from the Italian barbaros, meaning "stammerer or speaker of a foreign tongue" (from which we also get the word 'barbarian'), or from the Siculo-Arabic al-barberi, referring to someone "from the Barbery coast of North Africa (a Berber)". 



Bees are the most common insect found in heraldry and refer to industry, creativity, and wealth. Arrows signify martial readiness.
