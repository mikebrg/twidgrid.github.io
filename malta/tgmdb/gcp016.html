This parish was established by Bishop Davide Cocco-Palmeri on 28 April 1688. The building of the present church was initiated in 1690 and it was consecrated on 30 September 1726. The Cathedral apart, it is the oldest parish church consecrated in Gozo. It was conferred the Archipresbyteral status on 12 March 1963. Worthy of special mention is the altar-piece of the Immaculate Conception in a chapel in the left transept, known by the people as tal-Virtut, of the miracles. Several folk can swear to this day, that they see the radiant face of the Virgin turning yellowish and pale before an impending natural catastrophe. It is also said that one day, when some corsairs dared to devastate the countryside as far as the village, a lady that resembled the image in the altarpiece appeared on the spot hurling stones to repel the foe.
