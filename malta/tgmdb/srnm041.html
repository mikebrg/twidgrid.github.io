This surname first features on the Status Animarium (diocesan census) of Malta of 1687 when it was mostly found around the area of Ħaż-Żebbuġ.



Probably a derivative of an Italian personal name, such as Cecilia, Ciglia or Celia. The Siculo-Greek koilias (colloquially translated into Italian as cilia) means 'belly, womb' and may refer to a pot-bellied person or someone whose occupation involved pregnancy or delivering children.



Much like the Zahra coat of arms, this crest shows a blooming orange blossom, perhaps hinting at its etymology to birth and new life.
