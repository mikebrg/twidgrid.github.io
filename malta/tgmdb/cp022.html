When Hamrun grew a lot, the two old churches that were there, that of Samra and that of Nuzzu, were not enough for the needs of the people, and therefore a new church began to be built which, at the request of the bishop of ' at that time, Msgr. Gaetano Pace Forno, was dedicated to Saint Gaetano of Thiene. The church began to be used in 1875 and became a parish church in 1881.
