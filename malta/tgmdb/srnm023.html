We first encounter this surname in 1419 in its old local form of Bontempo.



An almost direct translation of the Italian referring to "good time", this surname most likely derives from a nickname given to a jolly or happy person  — buontempone in Italian.



A mullet in heraldry refers to a five-pointed star and symbolises virtue and piety. Here we see four in or (yellow/gold) which further emphasizes virtue as well as nobility, intelligence and prestige. The azure (blue) field stands for loyalty, fidelity, and honesty.
