Recorded as Abdalà and Abdalla(h) amongst others in the Militia Roster of 1417 though it has roots in Sicily dating back to at least 1178.



Most likely from the Siculo-Arabic name Abdella, itself from the Arabic Abdullâh, combining ‘abd and al-a‘lâ (Allah) to mean “servant of God”. A common nominative concept seen in the Italian (and Christian) surname Servadio and the Indian (and Hindu) name Devdas.



A frequent charge during the Crusades, the moor's head is a symbol of military victory against foreign powers. It is famously found on the Sardinian flag and heraldry.
