In Ħal Għaxaq, since the year 1511, there was a church dedicated to the Ascension of the Virgin Mary into heaven. Ħal Għaxaq became a parish on January 1, 1626 and the first priest was Rev. Mattew Scriha. The people of Ħal Għaxaq immediately took care of building a new church which was completed in 1655. Eighty years later the church that is there today was built.
