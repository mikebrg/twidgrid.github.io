Alexander Cachia Zammit , known as Sandy, ( Birżebbuġa , 11 August 1924 – 30 July 2014 ) was Minister for Social Services, Employment and Emigration between 1962 and 1966, and Minister of Health between 1966 and 1971. In 1987 he was appointed Ambassador of Malta to the Vatican.<p>He studied at the Lyceum and the Royal University of Malta where he graduated as a doctor in 1946. He spent three years in the public service until he began practicing as a doctor in private practice in 1949 in Żejtun.<p>Politics<br>
The son of Alfred and Helen born Asphar, like his father, he spent many years involved in politics where he contested his first election in 1955 with the Nationalist Party and continued to be elected until the 1981 election. 1955 was a crucial year for Malta. Architect Dom Mintoff was proposing Integration as a lasting solution for Malta. Cachia Zammit, a young 31-year-old doctor from Żejtun, was challenged by George Borg Olivier to contest the general election with the Nationalist Party.<p>
George Vella , Minister of Foreign Affairs in Labor and Żejtun governments, says that "Over a period of 32 years and more associated with politics, Sandy tasted and saw everything. It was a time when the political game was played, so to speak, "more crudely." He was a man who could have chosen a comfortable and easy life, and the earning of money, but instead chose to contribute to the good of society and to help the poor and the suffering."<p>Cachia Zammit retired from politics in 1987, and later served for a number of years as an ambassador.
