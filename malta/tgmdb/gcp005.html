The village church, designed by a local priest, Dun Guzepp Diacono, was build early in the twentieth century. Its foundation stone was laid on 6 September 1903 and it was dedicated to the Corpus Christi on 9 January 1916 to Christ the Saviour. The parish church was established by Bishop Giovanni Marija Camilleri on 16 December 1921.
