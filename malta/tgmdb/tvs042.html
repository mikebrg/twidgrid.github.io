Miraklu is a mini-series that tells the story of Joe 'il-Paps' Bonavia, father of five who returns from prison to a life in ruins - penniless, jobless, with four young mouths to feed and facing eviction. He looks for help from his brother, the parish priest - Father Randolf - who in turn introduces him to Princess a young immigrant in need of a job and a place to stay. From the outset, the relationship is off to a bad start due to Paps's racist beliefs and Princess's feisty temperament. Meanwhile, Paps decides he needs a radical plan if he is to get his life back on track. What he needs is nothing short of a miracle. In spite of their mutual dislike, Paps and Princess soon discover they desperately need one another if they are to pull out from a rapidly deteriorating series of events ignited by Paps's master plan.
