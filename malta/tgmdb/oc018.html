Cornerstone Pentecostal Church formerly known as Live Seed Christian Centre was founded in 2005 by Pastors Patrick and Josie Stevenson with the assistance of Paul and Valarie Balzan. Pastors Joseph and Helen Fenech Laudi joined Live Seed in 2008 and shortly after were invited to form part of the leadership. Upon the retirement of the Stevensons Joseph and Helen took over the lead of the Church on April 2015 at a special meeting presided by Gill Rodrieguez, who at the time was the Director of the Southern Europe Assemblies of God.
