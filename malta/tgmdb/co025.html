The Society for the transport of sick people to Lourdes was founded by Can. G. Azzopardi and two of his friends, Mr. G. Galea and Mr. G. Debrincat, after they had been to Lourdes. Seeing that only Malta was not present at Lourdes with sick people, they decided to form a society to organize pilgrimages of sick people to Our Lady’s sanctuary. With the blessing of Mgr. Maurus Caruana, bishop of Malta, the society was formed in 1931 with Can. Azzopardi as president, Mr. Galea as secretary and Mr. Debrincat as treasurer.
