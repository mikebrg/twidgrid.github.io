The Church of the Holy Family in Bidnija is a modern building in a Neo-classical design. The first foundation stone was laid in 1921 and built to the designs of the Maltese architect and stonemason Salvu Zahra (1874-1960) and paid for by the inhabitants of Bidnija to see to their spiritual needs. The church stands on a prominent hill, while its dome is clearly seen over the surrounding countryside.
