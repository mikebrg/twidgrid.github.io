Whilst this surname first features in Gozitan Crociata Records of 1533, it could date back to the late fifteenth century.



Almost certainly, this surname refers to someone from the Lombard city of the same name. Its etymology dates back to its founding by the Romans in the third century BCE, with carra meaning 'rock'.



Quatrefoils are a symbol of revival, purity and eagerness. Shown here in triplicate, they almost certainly refer to the holy trinity. The chief in argent (white, silver) contains a 'wavy' charge, perhaps indicating a connection to the sea.
