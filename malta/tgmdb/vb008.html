With a strong footing in the game of handball, Mr. Stephen Zammit was appointed as CEO of the club and under his guidance and advice the club grew into other sports. The club’s first move was into Futsal, however due to change in local regulations the club had to shut down its futsal team.  Today the club is represented in National Leagues of Basketball, Handball and Volleyball with nurseries in every sport. The club is also the first sporting entity to introduce the game of Floorball in Malta and is working hand in hand with the Malta Floorball Association to help this sport grow locally. The club has over 200 active athletes, not only local, but coming from a number of different countries.
