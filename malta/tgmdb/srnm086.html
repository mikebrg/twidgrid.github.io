Dating back to at least 1417, the Pax/Pace family are listed as a noble land-owning family in 1372.



From the Italian pace, meaning ‘peace, pardon’. In all likelihood, this surname has many different origins. Whilst there were certainly families from Italy by that name that came to Malta, it is likely that local Arab, Jew and Greek families Latinised their surnames from Salam, Shalom and Eirene respectively.



Both doves and olive fronds are symbols of peace.
