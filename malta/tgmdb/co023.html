The Opera dei Tabernacoli was founded in Malta by Bishop Pace with the aim of promoting the perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and of providing poor churches with liturgical vestments. The members of the Opera meet regularly in the convent of the Franciscan Sisters in Christopher Street at Valletta to prepare these vestments, which are then distributed to the churches after having been exhibited for three days in June. The Opera is affiliated to the Opera dei Tabernacoli of Rome.
