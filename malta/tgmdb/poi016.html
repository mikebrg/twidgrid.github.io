Verdala Palace is a palace in the Buskett Gardens, limits of Siġġiewi, Malta. It was built in 1586 during the reign of Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle, and it now serves as the official summer residence of the President of Malta. The palace was previously a residence of the British governor of Malta, together with the San Anton Palace, and was often used by British sovereigns and other royalty during their stay in Malta.
