Għasri Valley (Maltese: Wied il-Għasri) is a sea canyon on the Maltese island of Gozo. The gorge continues on the land towards the village of Għasri. The valley is known for its quiet beach, which is 300 metres (980 ft) inland from the sea. The sea is only accessible via a narrow cove with high cliffs on both sides. On the edge of the valley, next to an underwater cave, it is commonly believed that Maltese salt pans were built and maintained. It contains a secluded beach which is popular with tourists and divers alike.
