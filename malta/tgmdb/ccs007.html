The history of the Seminary Secondary School of Victoria, Gozo parallels that of the Sacred Heart Major Seminary, the place, which has always been synonymous with the candidates for priesthood and the preparation of such noble ministry in Gozo, since 1866. Such year is also notified for its foundation just a couple of years after the erection of the new diocese of Gozo by Blessed Pope Pius IX.
