Eve Borg Bonello MP (born 9 May 2003) is a Maltese activist and politician who grew to prominence during the 2019-2020 Maltese protests for her vocal opposition to former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and the corruption scandals that triggered the 2019 Malta political crisis and Muscat's eventual resignation. In April 2022, Borg Bonello was elected as a Member of Parliament in the 2022 Maltese General Election, becoming the youngest member ever elected to the Maltese House of Representatives in the country's constitutional history. She is the world's youngest sitting member in a national legislature.
