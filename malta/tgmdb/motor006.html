Island Car Club Malta

The Island Car Club has its origins in the Malta Branch of the Forces Motoring Club, which was active in the 1950s. The FMC was quite a high-powered organization, with headquarters in London and branches in a number of places where significant numbers of British servicemen were based, such as Cyprus, Aden and Singapore besides Malta. In the early years, Chairmen of the Malta Branch and many members were high-ranking officers like Army Colonels, Navy Captains and Air Force Group Captains. Later on, when the number of service people decreased with the rundown, the seniority level dropped too. Among leading lights of the period one recalls Bob Marshall, 'Bunny' Rabbits, David Wilson and the inimitable Bill Duxbury, who has retained links with Malta to the present day, and who’s red Ford Consul, affectionately known as The Fire Engine, was a regular participant in Club events.
