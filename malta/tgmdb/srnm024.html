Locally, this surname dates back to the late Middle Ages, most likely from the fifteenth century and perhaps earlier in its old form Burlus.



Potentially from the Siculo-Greek surname Bourlos meaning "mad, insane" or from the French surname Burlot, in turn from the French burle and refers to a "prankster" or "foolish person".



The main charges in this crest are a pair of mullets of six points in or (yellow/gold) symbolizing merit and honour, and three quatrefoils in argent (white/silver) representing revival, purity and eagerness.
