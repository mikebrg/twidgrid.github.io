We find this surname documented for the first time in Gozo in 1569 as De Soltano and, for many years, was restricted to Gozo only.



It is most likely derived from the Arabic sultân, meaning “king” or sultânah, which means “queen”. It May refer to a person who behaved in an outlandish of autocratic manner.



The charges of the moon and the sun on this coat of arms are a reference to Arabic and Ottoman cultures, whilst the crown and sceptre further reflect the potentially regal meaning.
