The Church of Saint Paul was built in 1577 based on a design by Glormu Cassar. Until the church was completed, the Priest administered the sacraments from the Church of Mount Carmel. The church was rebuilt between 1639 and 1679 and the chapels were rebuilt in 1835. In the year 1733 the church became collegiate.
