Documented in various forms such as Pucellu, Puccell and Buccellus from as early as 1283, we first encounter this surname in Malta in its current form from 1722.



Also of Italian origin, this surname is likely a form of Bucelli, itself from bucello meaning "calf" and probably refers to husbandmen or herdsmen. Alternatively, it may also be a derivative of the surname Buccello, a diminutive form of the Latin word bucco, meaning "cheek".



The three mullets of six points represent the holy trinity, shown in a fess over a party per pale field of gules (red) and azure (blue).
