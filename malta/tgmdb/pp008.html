Brain, not ego is a political party in Malta. It was announced on 3 February 2019 by Antoine P. Borg, who decided to contest the 2019 European Parliamentary elections. The party is a spin-off of a website of the same name containing political articles written by Borg himself. Borg, who has worked on Europe’s flagship space programme, Galileo, for the past eight years, stated that he was tired of the petty partisan politics seen in Malta and chose to step up to give citizens a better choice in the election booth.
