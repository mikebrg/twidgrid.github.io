We first see this surname documented in Malta in 1467, though it may date back further as the now extinct form Xara.



In Arabic, zahra is a feminine form meaning “(orange) blossom, blossoming flower”. In the form of Zah(i)ra, it is a given name that indicates “feminine beauty, radiance” and was a nickname given to Fatima, Muhammed’s Daughter.



The coat of arms shows an orange blossom in bloom, doubling down on its most likely meaning.
