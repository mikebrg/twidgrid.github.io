The Holy Name Society has been in existence since the Council of Lyons in 1274. In Malta it was introduced by Fr. Geraldo Paris O.P. in November 1928 and is now established in nearly all the parishes of Malta and Gozo. The Society each year organizes a National Congress, days of reparation in the various parishes, and retreats every three months for its members; it also publishes various books, prints, stickers, slogans, etc.
