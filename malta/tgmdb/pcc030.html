In November 1869, Zimelli retired on pension and Raffaele Bonello, the assistant superintendent of ports, was transferred to the police department as head of police. In March 1880, Bonello retired on pension at the age of 64 and Attillo Sciberras was appointed ommissioner of police (then styled superintendent of police) after his retirement as colonel of the 98th Foot Regiment of the British Army.
