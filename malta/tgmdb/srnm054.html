In its old form of de Guevara, we first encounter this surname in the mid-fifteenth century with Giovani and Diego de Geuvara listed as feudal tenants in Aayn Tuffieha.



Most likely referring to someone originating from the Sierra de Guara commune in Spain, it became syncopated as De Guevara in Italy. Potential Siculo-Arabic roots include daguara meaning 'whirlpool and dawwära meaning 'gulf, abyss, deep trench'.



Trees are rather common in Maltese heraldry and refer to strength and longevity. The shield is divided by five or (yellow, gold) roundels upon a gules (red) bend dexter.
