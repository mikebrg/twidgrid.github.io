The Basilica of the Nativity of Our Lady (Maltese: Knisja Kolleġġjata Bażilika ta' Marija Bambina) is a Roman Catholic parish church in Xagħra, Gozo, Malta, dedicated to the Nativity of Mary. The present building was constructed between 1815 and 1855, on the site of a smaller church which had been built in the 17th century. The dome was added in 1892. The church became a collegiate church in 1900, and a basilica in 1967.
