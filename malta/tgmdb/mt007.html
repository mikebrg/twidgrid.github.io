The Ħal Ġinwi temple (Maltese pronunciation: [ħalˈʒɪnwɪ]) was a prehistoric megalithic temple site located southeast of Żejtun, Malta dating back to the Ġgantija phase (3600-3200 BCE). The site is located in an area bearing the same name, or alternatively Ħal Ġilwi, which is known for its archaeological remains, and lies around one kilometre from the Tas-Silġ multi-period sanctuary and archaeological site.
