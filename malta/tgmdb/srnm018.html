First documented in Gozo in the year 1435, Briffa has two potential origins.



The first looks south, with (A)bu r-rafa being an Arabic nickname, made up of abû meaning “master” and rafa meaning “frail, humble, faint-hearted”. The second looks north, with Baruffa being an Italian nickname given to a man who does not shy away from a fight (baruffa means “squabble, scuffle”).



This coat of arms bears an impalement with a bendy dexter pattern in gules (red) and or (yellow, gold) on one side and flowers, symbols of joy and hope, over an argent (white, silver) field on the other.
