Paradise Bay is a beautiful beach located in the northern part of Malta, near Mellieħa. It is set within a natural cove and offers stunning views of the surrounding rugged landscape, over Malta’s sister Islands Gozo and Comino, and over the beautiful green-blue Mediterranean Sea. The bay is possibly the most attractive beach in Malta.
