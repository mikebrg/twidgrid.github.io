The old Church of Saint Mary was built in 1617 and was always considered a wonderful monument, although it was closed for a long time.  In 1950, the Birkirkara chapter decided to restore it and it was reopened in 1973.  After years in which it served as an autonomous pastoral area, this church became a parish on May 8, 2005.
