Manfredi Chiaramonte held the fief until his death in 1391. The fief was then inherited by his eldest child Elisabetta Chiaramonte. The actual management of the County was probably undertaken by her brother Andrea Chiaramonte. Andrea Chiaramonte was executed in 1392, having been accused as a major conspirator in the anti-Aragonese unrest during the early reign of Maria, Queen of Sicily.
