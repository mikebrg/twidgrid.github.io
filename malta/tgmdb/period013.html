Byzantine Rule
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
Between 535 and 870, Malta was under Byzantine rule following its recapture from the Vandals. This era saw the islands integrated into the Eastern Roman Empire, serving as a strategic naval base in the Mediterranean. Byzantine governance brought stability, with Malta becoming a key part of their defensive network against Arab expansion. The influence of Eastern Christianity also left its mark on Maltese religious practices and art. However, the islands faced frequent raids, which culminated in the Arab conquest of 870, ending Byzantine control and ushering in a new chapter in Malta's history.
