Saint Paul's Bay has always been a holiday resort, but by the beginning of the last century it had grown so much that the Sanctuary of Saint Paul could no longer cope with the needs of the local people. Therefore, the Marquise Anna Bugeja, in memory of the Holy Year of 1900, built a church dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows and gave it to the Conventual Franciscan Friars. The church became a Parish in 1905, and was enlarged as it is today between 1968-1979.
