Imġiebaħ Bay, tucked away on Malta’s northeastern coast near Mellieħa, is a serene and unspoiled haven known for its dog-friendly policies. This secluded pebble and sandy beach offers a tranquil retreat for pet owners seeking a peaceful spot to relax with their four-legged companions. Surrounded by rugged cliffs and lush Mediterranean greenery, the bay's crystal-clear waters are perfect for a refreshing swim, both for humans and their furry friends. With its remote location, Imġiebaħ Bay is ideal for those who appreciate nature's quiet beauty and wish to escape the busier tourist beaches. Visitors should note that access is via a narrow, uneven path, so comfortable footwear and some preparation are recommended for a perfect day out.
