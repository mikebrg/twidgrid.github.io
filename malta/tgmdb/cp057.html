In 1872 a priest from the City, Rev Pawl Vella, had a holiday home in Sliema. He began to struggle to build a church on land specially cleared by the Chapter of the Cathedral. The Church was started in 1877 and was dedicated to Our Lady of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, today known as Our Lady of the Sacro Cuor. The building was completed in June 1881 and in November of the same year it was given to the Minor Franciscan Friars. It became a Parish in 1918.
