BCSS takes pride in being a Catholic school, not only on paper but also in practice. Christianity is not only a religion to be practiced within certain spaces, but a way of life. This is something we incorporate at our school, both on a policy level but also on a personal level. A main pillar of Christianity is loving one another regardless of background, ability, race, or religion, which is why inclusion is a priority for us. We do our best to ensure there is equity in the processes by which students are accepted at our school. I make use of the word equity because each student has her own special needs and requirements, and we try to ensure we distribute our attention fairly and accordingly.
