The Ladies of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul were founded in 1617 by Saint Vincent de Paul. In Malta they were established, with the permission of the bishop, Mgr. Pubblio de’ Conti Sant, in 1860, by Mrs. Matilda Moore O’Ferral, the wife of the only Catholic Governor General of Malta during British rule. The Dame meet twice monthly in the convent of the Franciscan Sisters in Christopher Street, Valletta and provide help for needy families.
