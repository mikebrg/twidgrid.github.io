Marian Culture Group
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The Marian Culture Group was officially established in July 1959 by Mr. Joseph de’ Conti Manduca with the aim of organizing visits to the Marian Shrines of Malta and Gozo and promote Marian culture in Malta. The Group has over 600 members. Every month it organises Prayer Meetings and cultural visits to various Sanctuaries and churches, especially those dedicated to Our Lady, both in Malta and Gozo. Each year the Group organises a Marian Course of six lectures, which is open to all. Two closed Retreats are held in Advent and Lent. The Group is managed by an Executive Committee elected every two years during a General Meting. The Group’s motto is Ad Jesum per Mariam.
