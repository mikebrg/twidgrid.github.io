Stompers Rugby Club was first established in 1995. The initial years posed challenges and the club was more or less wound up a couple of years later, only to be reformed in 1999, proving resilience and tenacity from the get-go. Just two years following this resurgence, in 2001, we clinched our first trophy. This victory cemented our legacy and introduced the Bulldog Bark that will forever echo through Maltese rugby. Since then, Stompers has maintained a formidable presence in Malta Rugby.
