The Collegiate Basilica of St. Paul is built on the moat of the Roman city of Melita which was also part of Rabat. It is also built on a cave where, according to an old tradition, Saint Paul lived during the three months he spent in Malta in the year 60 AD. In 1336, the Bishop of Malta, Ilarju, called it ecclesia Sancti Pauli de crypta and also mentioned the Cemetery and its moat. Over the years, two churches were built on this cave by the Order of St. John dedicated to St. Publius.  The church of Saint Paul that is there today was built with the generosity of the nobleman Guzmana Navarra on the plan of F. Bonamico in 1653 and was completed by Lorenzo Gafà in 1683. It was built instead of another medieval one.
