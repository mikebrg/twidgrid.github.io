The Parish Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven (Maltese: Knisja Parrokkjali ta' Santa Marija Assunta) is a Roman Catholic parish church in Mġarr, Malta, dedicated to the Assumption of Mary. It was constructed between 1912 and 1946 on the site of an earlier church which had existed since around 1400. The building has a large dome with an elliptical plan; this shape is said to have been chosen because of its similarity to an egg, so as to encourage residents to sell eggs to raise funds for its construction.
