St. Patrick’s Salesian School opened its doors for the first boys in 1904, 120 years ago. Since then, the Salesians have worked hard for the benefit of the boys. Discussions with the authorities, wars, changes to regulation and so much more, have helped St. Patrick’s become what it is today. This project was a dream based on a dream: Alfons Maria Galea’s dream to bring the Salesians to Malta, the Salesians that came to be based on a dream of a 9 year old Giovanni Bosco. Last June, we celebrated this moment at the school grounds, and during the event we screened a 63 minute documentary about St. Patrick’s, ‘Ħolma li tfassal il-Ġejjieni‘. Written by Stephanie Bugeja, the Script Editor was Susanna Callus, and directed by Bryan Muscat, this documentary was produced by Stephanie Bugeja, Susanna Callus, Bryan Muscat and Fr. Jeremy Vella sdb.
