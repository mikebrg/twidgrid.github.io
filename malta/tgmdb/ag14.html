He was the first Public Prosecutor in Malta under the renamed system of the Office of the Crown Advocate after 1921: specifically, the office was re-designated to have dual functions (“Public Prosecutor and Treasury Counsel”) with Victor Frendo Azzopardi as the first Public Prosecutor in the period 1921-1928. <p>The legal office’s history: prior to 1921 the “Crown Advocate” handled many roles (legislation drafting, prosecution, civil advice). After responsible government in Malta (1921) the reorganisation took place. <p>In effect, his role was very important for criminal law matters in that period under Maltese self-government: the Public Prosecutor would deal with criminal law, while the Treasury Counsel handled civil law. <p>Context & Significance<p>The fact that the Office was reorganised in 1921 is significant: that’s around the time Malta began internal “responsible government” (i.e., more autonomy), and this legal reform reflects that shift. <p>Victor Frendo Azzopardi thus sits at an important juncture in Maltese legal history: he is among those who shaped the modern prosecutorial apparatus of Malta.<p>His tenure (1921-1928) means he would have been active during inter-war years, dealing with the legal burdens of that era in Malta.
