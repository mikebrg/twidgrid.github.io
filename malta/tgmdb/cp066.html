This is a Parish that takes care of the Catholics of the Greek Rite (Byzantine) in the Diocese of Malta and Gozo. It was founded in 1530 for the Greeks who came with the Knights of St. John from Rhodes and who were in full communion with the Catholic Church. The parish comprises two churches in Valletta: Saint Mary Damascene and Saint Nicholas.
