Dr Paul Pullicino writes about Sir Phillip:<p>

The following two stories were told to me by my father (Tony).<p>

His own father, Sir Philip, during worst months of the war, acting as counsel to the British Services represented an officer who was charged with an offence which he committed in front of countless witnesses. At the start of the court hearing Philip noticed that the magistrate’s staff was barring members of the public from entering the hall. After the officer was found guilty, Philip lodged a successful appeal to quash the verdict on the grounds that the hearing was not open to the public.
Prior to this, when Philip was Attorney General, a mother of five children whose husband had abandoned her came to his office seeking information as to his present whereabouts. She had heard that her husband had been interrogated by the police in connection with some crime and that his present address was on file. Philip told her that he was not permitted to divulge such confidential information as he slowly rose from his chair, excused himself momentarily and left the room, purposely leaving the file open on the page containing the address that she was after.
