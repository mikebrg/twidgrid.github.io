After the last war the Capuchin monks of Marsa took care of building a new church for the people who lived at the end of the parish far from the church. The church was dedicated to Our Lady of Tears, but then, by the people's own wish, before it was dedicated, the title was changed to that of Queen Mary. The church became a parish in 1967.
