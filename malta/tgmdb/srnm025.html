This surname was first recorded in 1419 on the Militia Roster as Busutil, Busictil, and Busitin among others, including a Fidericu Busitin.



Derived from a compound Arabic name (A)bûsittin, meaning ‘master of sixty men’, it was most likely given to a leader of militiamen who guarded the local coastline. 



It may also originate from (A)bû l-stallel, referring to someone who found success in keeping stables. Though this meaning is less likely, it could explain the presence of a calf, representing patience, humility and sacrifice, and a fes in or (yellow/gold), representing success and respect, on this coat of arms.
