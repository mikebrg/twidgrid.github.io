Viking village Flake's chief Halvar orders clever, tiny son Wickie to rob a knights convoy. The warriors must take over but fail to see Wickie being abducted with a cargo of Eskimo slaves who also carry a mysterious manuscript on the eternal ice palace containing the Norse gods' treasure. Wickie escapes, and the thief who refuses to help him comes along as stowaway.
