The Accession Process to the European Union
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
Between 1987 and 2004, Malta underwent significant political and economic transformations, culminating in its accession to the European Union. The process began in 1990 when Malta formally applied for EU membership. Over the next decade, reforms were implemented to align the country with EU standards, particularly in areas such as trade, governance, and human rights. Following a decisive referendum in 2003, where the majority of Maltese citizens voted in favor of joining, Malta signed the Accession Treaty. On May 1, 2004, Malta officially became a member of the European Union, marking a historic milestone in its journey as a modern, globally integrated nation.
