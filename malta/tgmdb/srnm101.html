Dating back to the late Middle ages, the Spetere family held the fief of Santa Maria Magdalena (il-Madliena) in 1439.



Originating from the Italian name Spitaleri, itself derived from the Latin hospitarius and indicates a connection with the knights Hospitallers.



The above-mentioned connection has suggested that this surname was given to the illegitimate children of the Knights residing in Malta. However, the surname predates the order reaching the islands.
