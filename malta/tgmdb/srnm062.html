Dating back to at least the fifteenth century and seen in the Militia Roster of 1417. 



From the Arabic al-farrûdj, meaning "one who keeps chickens". Tentatively, farrûdj, or "hen", can also signify love for one's family as well as a provider of comfort and support.



Chickens are relatively commonplace in Maltese heraldry, and usually, signify fertility and a plentiful harvest. The town of Ħal Farruġ refers to "Farruġ’s Farmstead". Coincidentally, a nearby former hamlet of Ħal Millieri refers to "(Ca)milleri’s farmstead".
