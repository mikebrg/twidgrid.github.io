Edward Bencini was replaced by Enoch Tonna. Someone who knows the facts told me that pressure was exerted, but the exact words used were “kienet saret ħidma” (there had been manipulation) so that Enoch Tonna would be appointed Police Commissioner, even though, there were other officers, who were senior to him. These officers were staunch Labourites among whom were William Moran, John Cachia and Pawlu Mamo. Yet, Tonna’s career as a Commissioner of Police was short lived.
