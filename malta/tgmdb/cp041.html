Mtarfa, which used to be part of the Parish of Rabat, has seen an increase in population in recent years. For a long time, the church of Santa Lucia was used for the people who live in Mtarfa, a church that was built around the year 1460. Then, after the British left Malta, around 1980, instead of the church of Santa Lucia, the church of San Oswald was used, which was the church of the British military hospital. Then the need for a Pastoral Center and a new and bigger Church was felt. On 19 April 2000, Mtarfa became an Autonomous Zone and on 8 December 2004 it was declared a Parish.
