First documented in Malta in 1417, we find it recorded as Brancati among the Christian serfs of Sicily in 1178.



Most likely deriving from the Italian surname Brancato, itself from the Greek Pankrates (Latinized as Pancratius, and anglicised as Pancras) and means “omnipotent” (pan meaning “all” and kratos meaning “power”) and was an honorific title for Christ and the name of a Byzantine saint and martyr.



The three mullets of six points represent the holy trinity, further echoing the Christian theme. Hands clasped symbolise peace and loyalty, whilst the tree represents strength.
