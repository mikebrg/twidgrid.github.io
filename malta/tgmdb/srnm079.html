First listed in the Militia Roster of 1419, almost all evidence point to this surname originating from the Italian nickname Mangione meaning “glutton”, with mangiare being Italian for “to eat” and manducare being Latin for “to chew.”



Castles in heraldry signify protection and, when argent (silver/white), religious safety. The sanguine (red) lion atop it a symbol of vigilance, courage and fidelity.
