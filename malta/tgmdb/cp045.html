The stretch of land between St George's Bay and Baħar ic-Cagħaq, known as Pembroke, was occupied by the British military for a long time. Some German Catholic prisoners had built a small chapel towards the end of the war. With the end of the British military base in Malta, some Maltese started to occupy some places that the British services had when the Government had given some plots. The chapel was renovated by the Architect Richard England at the invitation of the parish priest of St. Julian's. Then Pembroke was cut off from the Parish of St. Julian when Ibrag became an Autonomous Pastoral Area and therefore became part of the Ibrag area. As the area continued to increase in population, Pembroke became an Autonomous Pastoral Area in 1998. It became a Parish on December 8, 2004 with the Church dedicated to the Risen Christ.
