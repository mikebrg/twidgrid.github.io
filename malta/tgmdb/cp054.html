The old church of Santa Venera was entrusted to the Carmelite monks in 1912 when there were not many people there. Six years later, Santa Venera became a parish. Because the population continued to increase, the monks felt the need to build another church in a more central location, in Triq San Guzepp. On 3 December 1989 the new church became the parish church and on 6 October 1990 the first stone of the new church was laid. It was blessed on July 17, 2005.
