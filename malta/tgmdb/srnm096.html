This surname was first recorded in Malta in the late 1430s, however, in the form of Asante, it dates back to the late thirteenth century.



Deriving from the Italian name Santo, itself from the Latin sanctus meaning "holy, saintly, pious". It may also be a truncated version of the French surname Van Sant, in which sant refers to a "sandy place".



The three candles in this coat of arms are a nod towards the saintly etymology of this surname whilst also representing the holy trinity. The azure (blue) field is associated with nobility and sacredness whilst symbolizing loyalty, fidelity, perseverance and honesty.
