The church of St Mary was founded in the seventeenth century, in thanksgiving. According to an account given in the records of the 1565 pastoral visit, the Virgin Mary appeared to a poor local maiden and cured her from her illness. This gave rise to the special devotion associated with this church and is recorded in two marble plaques placed on the façade of the church in 1950. This church is built on high ground which dominates the surrounding landscape, overlooking the valley towards the coast.
