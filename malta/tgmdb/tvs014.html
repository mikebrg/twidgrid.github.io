An award-winning crime thriller spanning over 52 episodes. The Evangelists were a prolific gang of thieves that, ten years before the opening of our story, had made a reputation for themselves in the local criminal underworld, and amassed a fortune stealing religious artifacts from various churches which they then resold on the international black market.
