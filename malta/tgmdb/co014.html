Malta Catholic Youth Network (MCYN) is the office dedicated to youth within the Archdiocese of Malta which seeks to engage with young individuals and share its vision. Grounded in three core principles, the organisation focuses on connecting peers who are passionate about spreading the message of Jesus, fostering a community dedicated to positive peer influence, and being relevant witnesses to society.
