As both Busalib and Salibe, this surname can be found on the Militia Roster of 1417.



Of Arab descent, it is linked to the name Abû l'salibi and refers to a crusader or simply a Christian living in a Muslim community. Tentatively, it may also originate from the Arabic nickname sakâliba, which referred to Slavs and other fair-haired peoples from Northern Europe.



Unintuitively, no crosses feature on the coat of arms, but the three stars ensure that the Christian faith is still represented. Saliba can also be found among the Christian communities of Lebanon and Syria.
