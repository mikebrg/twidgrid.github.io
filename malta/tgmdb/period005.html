Between 1945 and 1964, Malta underwent significant political changes, transitioning from British colonial rule to full independence. In 1947, Malta was granted self-government with the introduction of Home Rule, allowing the island to manage its internal affairs, though Britain retained control over defense and foreign policy. The period saw growing political unrest and the rise of nationalist movements advocating for greater autonomy. In 1964, Malta achieved full independence from the United Kingdom, becoming a sovereign nation within the Commonwealth. This marked the beginning of a new era for Malta, with a focus on nation-building and international diplomacy.
