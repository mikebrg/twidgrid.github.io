In 1282, during the Sicilian Vespers uprising, it appears that the island was easily taken over by the Crown of Aragon, with local aid. Aragonese control initially excluded the Castrum Maris, which did not fall until 1283, following after the naval Battle of Malta. It was therefore in 1282 that Andreolo da Genova was given the title of Count of Malta. He and his family had supported the native rebels in aiding the Aragonese claimants to the Sicilian throne.
