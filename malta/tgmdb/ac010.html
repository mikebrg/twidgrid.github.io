The Mellieha Athletic Club (“Mellieha AC”) was founded back in 1992. Mellieha AC, on an individual athlete basis and as a team, has always offered stiff competition and at times achieved first position. Our club attracts serious runners of all abilities and fitness goals ranging from the recreational runner to the highly competitive road racer. We are a very social club and very supportive of all our member’s running goals. Most importantly, we have a good time running.
