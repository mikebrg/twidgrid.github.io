Roberta is widely referred as the First Lady of Maltese Dance Music and a highly respected DJ and promoter with an exponentially growing career that has spanned over the last 24 years. Through Roberta's enigmatic charm and promotional skills in 2001 she went on to form what is now widely regarded as one of the longest and most successful Club night in the Maltese Islands which is GET FUNKY. Roberta has constantly evolved her style of music over the years to reflect the changing face of House music. She is a lady that combines technical ability and glamour on the decks, spinning a mix of melodic house, progressive house and Techno. Quality music is her motto and she shines in her ability to deliver an outstanding set every time she is called on duty. With her extensive musical background, Roberta can ignite any party being in front of a 3,000 sweaty clubbers in a warehouse party, to an intimate 500 capacity club. You cannot fail to be seduced by Roberta's sounds.
