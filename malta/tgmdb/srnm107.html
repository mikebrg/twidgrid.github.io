Dating back to at least the early Aragonese times, when a Graziano Vassallo was noted to have established his family in circa 1320.



An Italian surname derived from the medieval Latin word vassallus, referring to a ‘feudal tenant’ (a ‘vassal’, in English). It may also be a truncated form of the Italian Surname Bonavassallo, meaning ‘good tenant, efficient vassal’.
