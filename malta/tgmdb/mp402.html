Following her defeat, Bonaci remained active in the Labour Party; she ran again in the 1987 election, but was defeated. During her tenure, Bonaci was a member of the Maltese delegation to a conference of the Commonwealth of Nations. In 1995, Bonaci was named an "officer of the National Order of Merit".<p>Bonaci died in Luqa on 16 December 2008 at the age of 92. Members of both major parties expressed condolences, including Tonio Borg and Joseph Muscat of the Labour Party.
