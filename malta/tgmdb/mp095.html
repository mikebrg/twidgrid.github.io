Gozitan lawyer Joseph Ellis has been elected to Parliament following a casual election in the 13th district. The seat was previously held by PN stalwart Frederick Azzopardi, who died last month. The election was contested by Joseph Ellis, Censu Galea, Maria Portelli, Jason Zammit and Ryan Mercieca. The PN had earlier disassociated itself from Mr Mercieca, who has a history of run ins with the law.
