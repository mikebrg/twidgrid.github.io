First recorded in Malta in 1644 with the Notitia de vocaboli ecclesiasti noting a Domenico Magri, born in Valletta in 1604. 



Most likely the plural version of the Italian surname and Magro, referring to someone lean or thin, though the Maltese variant of Magro may have separate origins. The Italian surname Macri is from the Greek makros meaning "large, long".



Here we see a dog passant regardant (walking whilst looking back) seemingly being followed by a dove. Dogs are symbols of loyalty and vigilance whilst doves are symbols of peace and charity.
