The first stone of the Church, dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, was blessed on January 14, 1945 and the church was finished on December 31, 1946. The official opening took place on January 1, 1947. The Mass started the next day. In May of the following year, a new community was formed with four religious who lived in a house next to the church. In the Provincial Chapter of 1949 this community was completely severed from that of Santa Venera.  On 25 January 1975 Fleur-de-Lys became a parish. The limits of the parish were taken from those of Santa Venera Parish together with a few families from Santa Elena Parish, Birkirkara. On the 10th of February 1991 the limits of the Parish were extended with the addition of families from the parishes of Saint George, Qormi, Santa Venera and Santa Elena, Birkirkara. From Monday 9 January 2023, the pastoral care of the people of God gathered in the parish of Fleur-de-Lys will fall under the direct responsibility of the diocesan Clergy. Archbishop Charles Scicluna appointed Rev. Darren Pace as parish administrator of this parish.
