The Church of St Roque (Maltese: Knisja ta' San Rokku, Romanian: Biserica Sfântul Rocco) is a 17th-century Baroque church located in Valletta, Malta. The church is the official parish church of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Malta and is subsequently used for Orthodox Divine services. The Romanian Orthodox parish is dedicated to the Birth of John the Baptist. The church still remains officially owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta.
