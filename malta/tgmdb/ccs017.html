Father Diacono was born in Rabat, Gozo in 1847 … On 4 January 1878, Archpriest Felice Refalo appointed him Spiritual Director of the association of the “Crown of Twelve Stars of the Heart of Jesus” …This association consisted of group of young women who met periodically to pray and discuss ways in which to show devotion to the Sacred Heart. Father Diacono was happy to guide these pious women and immediately set up a more detailed programme of action for this group… Under the guidance of Father Diacono, the number of women increased considerably, and early in 1879, Father Diacono rented a house, at 54 Triq Ghajn Qatet for a modest fee so that the group could gather there. Meanwhile the meetings became more frequent and those responsible for the upkeep of the house went there every day. This house was named Casa di Carita’ - House of Charity, and it became the focal point of a host of spiritual and social gatherings, the former presided by Father Diacono, the latter presided by the members of the Twelve-starred Crown… At a time when the rights of women were practically unheard of, this energetic priest wanted to found a community where spirituality and labour would prevail… Fully conscious that poverty thrives on ignorance, he set up classes to impart basic education to the poor so that one day they could help themselves out of their own adversities. Secondly he organised lace-making lessons, thus greatly raising the standards of the product and hence increasing the income of lace-makers from its sale.
