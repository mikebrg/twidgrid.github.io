Initially listed as Cutaje from as early as 1419, the suffix -r has only been seen in records since the seventeenth century.



Probably related to the Sicilian topographic term cutaia, itself derived from the Arabic quttayah (from which we get the Maltese quċċata) meaning 'hilltop, crest'.



The argent (silver or white) field on this coat of arms symbolises wisdom, innocence, peace and joy. The lion signifies courage or a brave leader whilst the fleur-de-lis or golden lily/iris, a symbol of France, denotes perfection, light, and life.
