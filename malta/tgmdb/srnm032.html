Present on the Maltese islands since at least the late 14th Century, Cardona features amongst members of the Aragonese garrison of Count Ruggerio di Loria in 1283.



The most likely origin of the surname relates to the Spanish city of the same name close to Barcelona which dates from before the Roman occupation of the area. It may also be a diminutive form of the name Riccardona.



An or (gold/yellow) field is a symbol of success, intelligence and prestige. Coupled with the frond of grass it may indicate success in agriculture or land ownership.
