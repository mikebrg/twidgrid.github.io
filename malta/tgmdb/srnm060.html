Dating back to at least the early fifteenth century we find, amongst others, an Antoni Hellule listed on the Militia Roster of 1417.



Derived from the Jewish name Elul, the name of the sixth month of the Jewish calendar (from mid-August to mid-September), in turn potentially from the Babylonian Ululu which related to children born within that corresponding period. In Arabic ‘aylûl means "September".



The three mullets of six points are a symbol of the Christian faith whilst the moon is a symbol of honor and hope. they are separated by fess (bar), all in argent (silver/white).
