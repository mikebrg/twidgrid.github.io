Xgħajra is a small coastal village in the southeastern part of Malta. It’s located on the coast, about halfway between Valletta and Marsaskala. The village has a population of around 1,800 inhabitants but is growing as a coastal resort town with close access to the tourist areas of the Three Cities and the capital Valletta.
