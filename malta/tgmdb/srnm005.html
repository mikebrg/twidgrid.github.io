" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
One of the oldest surnames recorded on the islands, it was first documented in Gozo in the year 1299, a certain Tristanus de Actardo.



A surname of Sicilian origin, it is composed of atha meaning "noble" and hardu, meaning "brave". It may also be related to the Arabic al-attar, a "perfume merchant".



The Maltese village of the same name is said to originate from the Attardo family who, in the 15th century, owned a large estate in the area and managed to unite multiple hamlets into one parish in 1575.
