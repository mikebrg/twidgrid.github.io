The areas known as Swatar and Tal-Qattus formed part of the parish of Birkirkara - Saint Helen. Since these areas had begun to develop, the need was felt to increase the pastoral service for them. In 1989, Canon Rev. Karm Busuttil started celebrating mass in the MUSEUM Center and in some houses until the Pastoral Center was completed. In 2004 the church was completed and, by decree of 3 December 2006, Swatar became an autonomous pastoral area. Msgr. Archbishop Paul Cremona O.P. established the autonomous area of ​​Swatar as a parish under the title of Saint George Preca, with effect from 8 November 2008.
