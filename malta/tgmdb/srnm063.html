In the form of Fenec, this surname can be found on the Militia Roster of 1417.



Almost certainly from the Arabic (and Maltese) fenek meaning "rabbit", or fanak, meaning "fox".  This may refer to a fleet-footed or timmed person or a hunter of hares. Though some may claim a connection with the Phoenicians, Malta's ancient colonisers, this is a tentative one at best.



Rabbits in heraldry refer to those who are strong of faith, as well as a symbol of love, beauty, and fertility. The three mullets of six points represent the family's Christian faith.
