Former journalist, author and group scout leader John A. Mizzi was a Gozitan MP and poet. Marcel Mizzi, who died on February 4 aged 90, should also be fittingly remembered.<p>Marċell, as we all knew him, was a man who loved Gozo and did his best to promote its well-being. He was a Labour member of the Legislative Assembly in 1955 and resigned over the Integration issue. He became a Nationalist MP in 1963 in a casual election after the death of another Nationalist MP, George Galea. He was a popular legal procurator and he helped many poor people in their legal needs with his clear advice.<p>To Gozitan poets and authors, Marċell was one of the best models and we admired his simplicity in poetry and love of nature. His book of poetry, Il-Mewt taż-Żgħażagħ u Poeżiji Oħra (1997), is a flowery anthology of his best poems formerly published in various newspapers, magazines and schoolbooks. I used to have long discussions with him about the beauty of Gozo and the need to protect our environment, especially through poetry.<p>He also had a good sense of humour. The biggest blow for him was the sudden disappearance of his son, Paul, and he assiduously searched for him awaiting his return. Gozo misses another beloved son, a real poet in heart and mind!
