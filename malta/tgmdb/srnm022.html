We find this surname listed on the Militia Roster of 1419, with roots in Sicily dating back to the mid-twelfth century.



Most likely a surname of Siculo-Arabic origin linked with the occupational name (A)bû l-hadjar(i) referring to a thriving landlord or a proprietor of a stone quarry. It is made up of the Arabic elements abû, meaning "father, master, holder, possessor" and hadjar, which means "stones".



An argent field means purity, wisdom, innocence, sincerity, peace and joy, whilst birds in heraldry represent love for the family.
