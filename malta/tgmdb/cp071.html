Żejtun, which in the old days was known as Bisqallin, is one of the parishes that already existed in 1436, and until the church that is there today was built, the old church of Saint Catherine, known as ' Old Saint Gregory, was the parish church. The church that is there today was built between 1692 and 1720 and is one of the most beautiful works of Lorenzo Gafà.
