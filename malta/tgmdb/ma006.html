Apotheosis (Malta) was born in late '93. Practical in the areas of ambient electronic music and heavily impressed by the intense sound and atmosphere of Black Metal of the early 90s, the creator and sole member of the project, Sauron, embarked on a quest to blend these two dimensions of music. Armed with only an Amiga computer (8 bit sound, only 4 voice polyphonic and 1 megabyte of ram), an old 4 track, a cheap reverb box and a microphone, he set out to make these two intense areas of music converge into one style. And attempt to cope with the ratio of a ton of ideas to a very restricted audio setup. The earliest Apotheosis material was quite primitive. It hovered more along the ambient zone with textures and passages derived from the cryptic and cold realms of Black Metal. After a year of experimentation, the material recorded was clearly showing the evolution of this project, from rudimentary ambient passages to properly organised guitars, to vocals.
