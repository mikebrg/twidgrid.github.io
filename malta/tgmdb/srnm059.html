In old local forms including H(i)beier, Abejer and Hebejer,  we see this surname first listed in the Militia Roster of 1419, with roots in Sicily dating as far back as the 12th century.



Of Semitic origin, this surname is linked to the Arabic occupational name (Bû) 'l-'Abâ'ir, incorporating the abûra, meaning "young goat" and therefore most likely referring to goatherd.



The three mullets on this coat of arms represent the holy trinity. Chevrons in heraldry represent a roof or shelter and, in triplicate, may refer to a property owner or landlord. A field of azure (blue), symbolises loyalty, fidelity, perseverance and honesty.
