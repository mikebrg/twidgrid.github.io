Bronze Age
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
Between 2350 BC and 700 BC, Malta transitioned into the Bronze Age, marked by significant cultural and technological changes. The megalithic temple-building era gave way to fortified settlements, such as the clifftop site of Borġ in-Nadur. Bronze tools and weapons began to replace stone, showcasing advancements in metallurgy. This period also saw the construction of dolmens—small, table-like stone structures thought to be burial sites. The societal shift reflects a move towards a more defensive and structured way of life, laying the groundwork for the island's evolving civilizations.
