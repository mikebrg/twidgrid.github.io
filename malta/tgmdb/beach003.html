Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq is named after a long stretch of rocky coast characterized by a large number of pebbles and sharp rocks. The area was used as a camping site by British forces during the British colonial period of the islands. A modern central parish church and Franciscan retreat house are also located in the village.
