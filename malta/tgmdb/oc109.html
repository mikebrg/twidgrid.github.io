The chapel that we see today was built around 1771 and consists of a small structure typical of rural chapels in Malta. It was once a solitary building in the middle of the countryside, visited mostly by hunters and farmers who hunted or worked in the area of Tal-Wej - which today is a protected site due to its ecological and cultural importance.
