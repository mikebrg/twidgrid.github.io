Malta in the Interwar Period
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
Between 1919 and 1939, Malta experienced significant political and social change during the Interwar Period. Following World War I, the island saw growing nationalist movements pushing for greater self-governance. In 1921, the British granted Malta a new constitution, establishing a semi-autonomous government with a locally elected legislative assembly. However, tensions between the British authorities and local political factions remained high. During the 1930s, Malta's strategic importance in the Mediterranean grew, especially with the rise of fascist regimes in Europe. The island became increasingly militarized, and its population faced economic challenges as the global depression took a toll. Malta's role as a key British naval base remained crucial, especially as the threat of war loomed over Europe.
