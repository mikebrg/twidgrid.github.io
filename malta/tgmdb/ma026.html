Initially formed under the name ' Euthanasia' as a thrash metal act by Michael and Carlo. Both amateur guitarists, their influences in bands such as Venom, Bathory and Slayer pathed the way in experimenting guitar techniques and riffing. Music patterns were born, oriental and dark and their partnership in music grew deeper. Their fellow collegues being both novices in playing drums and bass, never advanced, leaving no choice but to recruit other members. Dino joined on drums. Now being a four piece with Will 'Grizzly' (Norm Rejection vocalist) on keyboards. The remaining place on bass was taken by Rex. His music mastery enhanced what Michael and Carlo created, thus making Lithomancy an athmospherical death metal band with touches of black metal. Mike also took the vocal role, lyrics dealing in egyptology and occult which also complimented their music. Tracks like ‘The Neophyte Ceremony’, ‘Osiris On-Nophris’ and ‘Madame Zarathusera’ were the source for moshpits during their first appearance at the 'Rock for the Fort' held at the Rinella Fort in 1995. Hailed as one of the promising bands, Lithomancy took part in the ‘Lobotomy’ gig held at the White Rocks complex in early 1996.
