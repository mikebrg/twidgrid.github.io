Qarraba Bay is a small bay that is actually part of the much larger Gnejna Bay. It is located at the base of the Qarraba promontory, surrounded by steep, crumbling slopes on the northwest side, and characteristic clay slopes on the north and northeast. A small rocky and flat promontory called Snorkeling Point separates it from the rest of Gnejna Bay. At the foot of the clay slopes in the northeastern part of the bay lies a small pebble and clay beach.
