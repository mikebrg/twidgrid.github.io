Listed as Hayculina, this surname can be found on the Militia Roster of 1417.  It probably derives from the Italian aquila, and means "eagle", with the suffix -ina added to make the diminutive form.



In the Late Middle Ages ayculina referred to a specific coin and the term may have been adopted as a replacement for Arabic currency-based names such as Dinari. Other sources may include the Latin aquilum, meaning "dark waters".



Eagles in heraldry refer to boldness and a person of action whilst an or (gold) field means majesty, success, respect and virtue.
