In the form of Micci and Miczi this surname was first recorded in Zurric (Żurrieq) in the 1480’s.



Most likely derived from an Italian surname Mizio that is derived from the modern Greek mitses or mitsos, meaning "tiny, small, little one". Also potentially from yet another Italian surname, Dimizio, which means "to tame".



This coat of arms displays a Latin cross in gules (red), a symbol of the Christina faith.
