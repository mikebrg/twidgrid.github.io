It is of utmost importance that BKVC members find a friendly and family-like atmosphere by coaches, team-mates and also administrative staff throughout this life experience. Members are greatly encouraged to excel and love this game with dedication, determination, desire and discipline. To achieve the above values, one is trained to respect, be responsible and fully support sportsmanship. Participants are welcome to attend our sessions to make a change in their lifestyle and learn the Club's R.E.S.P.E.C.T principles. BKVC is thankful for all the support received from Birkirkara Local Council. BKVC clan has a senior women competitive team which competes in the Malta Volleyball Association league from when it the inception of the club. Along its way, BKVC commenced youths' training and also decided, to promote active lifestyles, to offer this sport also to interested seniors (both females and males) in an uncompetitive environment. This team, named as Fun Volley, helps members to unwind from sedentary lifestyles by training this fun, energetic and challenging sport.
