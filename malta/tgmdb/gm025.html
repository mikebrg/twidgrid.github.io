Fra' Ramón Despuig y Martínez de Marcilla (Catalan: Ramón Despuig i Martínez de Marcilla; Catalan pronunciation: [rəˈmon dəsˈputʃ]; 1670, Mallorca - 15 January 1741, Malta) was a Spanish knight of Aragon who served as the 67th Grand Master of the Order of Malta from 1736 until his death. He was succeeded by Manuel Pinto da Fonseca. During his reign, the legislation of the small state was renewed and the Cathedral of St. John in Valletta was reformed. Several vessels of the Algerian Navy were also captured by the Order's galleys during his reign.
