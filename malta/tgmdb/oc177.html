The Church of Saint Nicholas (Maltese: Il-Knisja ta' San Nikola, Greek: Εκκλησία του Αγίου Νικολάου, Serbian: Црква Светог Николе), also known as the Church of All Souls (Maltese: Il-Knisja tal-Erwieħ), is a Greek Catholic church in Valletta, Malta, dedicated to Saint Nicholas. Originally built as a Greek Orthodox church in 1569, it was conceded to the Confraternity of the Souls in Purgatory in 1639, who rebuilt the church in the Baroque style in 1652. The church was passed back to the Greek Catholic congregation in 2014 however the church is used from Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.
