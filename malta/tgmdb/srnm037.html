Dating back to at least the Late Middle Ages we find, amongst others, Paulu Cauki listed on the Militia Roster of 1417.



There is evidence that this surname evolved from Gauci and has roots in Gozo (with Għawdxi being the masculine form of 'Gozitan' in Maltese). Alternatively, it may come from the Italian nickname kaukes or kakos which are derived from the Greek words for 'bad, evil' or 'spiteful person'.



This rather ornate coat of arms shows either the Poseidon/Neptune or a merman holding a heraldic dolphin, with the latter being a symbol of charity, agility and vigilance.
