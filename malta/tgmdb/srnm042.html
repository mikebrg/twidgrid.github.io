We do find an Antoni Chini recorded in the Militia Roster of 1417, however, the surname is absent from records until resurfacing again prominently in the Angara Roster of the 1480s.



All sources point to an Italian origin, such as it being a derivative of the personal name Cino. Surnames such as Bencini, Mancini or Seracini, incorporating -cino and -cini as hypocoristic, indicate a diminutive form or pet name.



This coat of arms incorporates a field lozengy, created through the combination of diagonal stripes, starting from the dexter (right) side and from the sinister (left) side.
