Our Church school is run by the Daughters of the Sacred Heart together with a dedicated lay staff who all work together with love and diligence. As a school we feel enriched by the diversity of pupils whom we accept lovingly into our school without any distinction of ability, socio-economic class or race. On the example of our Foundress Maria Theresa Nuzzo, we work hard to create an environment of love and care for each and every pupil as well as a recognition of their intrinsic worth.
