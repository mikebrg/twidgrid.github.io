Għawdex Illum is weekly broadcasting on the Maltese national television network. It is produced and directed by Alvin Scicluna who also scripts features with several valid and longstanding colleagues that include Joe Camilleri (arts and culture), Anton F Attard (environment, folklore and traditions) and Rev Dr Joseph Bezzina (history). This programme focuses on everything that is Gozitan - from administration to voluntary work, from history and culture to current affairs, from people living in Gozo to those who have taken the island`s reputation far and away.
