The Regional Councils, which were formerly called Regional Committees, were established by Legal Notice No: 320 of 2011 dated 5th August 2011. The Regional Council is another level of Local Government established by Legal Notice No: 87 of 2019. The Regional Level of Government is relatively young as a system of governance in Malta and Gozo. In fact, as of January 2022, Malta became sub-divided into six regions - Gozo, Tramuntana, Punent, Lvant, Xlokk, and Port. These Regional Councils were established and set-up through the amendment of the Local Councils Act in 2019. The Gozo Regional Council is one of the Six Regional Councils representing all the Regions of Malta and Gozo.
