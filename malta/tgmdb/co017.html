The Mission Fund was set up on 16th April, 1984 by Ian and Rita Azzopardi of Mosta with the aim of fostering the missionary spirit in the Maltese Islands and helping missionaries in Third World Countries which today number around 250. This is a voluntary organization, run by lay people who are trying to put in practice God’s message of love.
