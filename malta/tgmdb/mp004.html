Andy Ellul (born 1975) is a Maltese politician from the Labour Party. He was elected to the Parliament of Malta in the 2022 Maltese general election from District 3. He was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Social Dialogue in the Maltese Government. Ellul is a lawyer by profession. In October 2023, he faced accusations that he used public funds to pay for Facebook adverts. Ellul strongly rebutted the accusations, stating that the complaint which related to a video announcing the 'Worker of the Year Award', published on the Ministry's official page, was unfounded.
