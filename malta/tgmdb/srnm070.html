This surname seems to have reached the Maltese islands quite late, with the first recording of it being the electoral lists of 1849.



Of Italian origin, this surname may be a condensed form of Giorgio di Maina, with maina referring to the Norman-French magne, maine meaning "great, strong, tall".



This complex crest shows a dexter arm, a symbol of prosperity, merit and qualities of leadership, pointing at a tower, signifying strength and vigilance.
