Under various forms, including D’Armanino, Darmani, and D’Armani, including the pleasing Pinu Darmaninu, we first see this surname documented in Malta in the Militia Roster of 1417.



Most Likely from the Italian D'Armanno, with Armanno referring to a 'soldier' or 'of the army'. It originates from the old Germanic harima(n) (hari meaning army and mann meaning man), which is also the root of the name Herman.



A tower with turrets symbolises protection and vigilance. Through an association with Jerusalem, it is also a symbol of piety.
