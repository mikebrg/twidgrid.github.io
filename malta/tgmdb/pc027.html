The Parish Church of St Cajetan of Thiene (Maltese: Knisja Parrokkjali ta' San Gejtanu ta' Thiene) is a Roman Catholic parish church in Ħamrun, Malta, dedicated to Saint Cajetan. The church was constructed between 1869 and 1875 to designs of Giorgio Costantino Schinas, in a combination of architectural styles. The oratory and dome were added later on in the 1890s and 1950s; the latter was designed by Andrea Vassallo and it was constructed under the direction of Ġużè Damato.
