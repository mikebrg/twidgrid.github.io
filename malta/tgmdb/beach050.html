Xrobb L-Għagin is an area in southeastern Malta. It is mostly known due to the nature park located inside its boundaries which goes by the same name. It is also home to Xrobb l-Għaġin Tower, which is a ruined De Redin watchtower. The peninsula was also home to a Deutsche Welle relay station which later became the nature park main building.
