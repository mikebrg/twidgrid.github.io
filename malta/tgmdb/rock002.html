The MCC is a non-commercial organisation that brings together all who are interested in the climbing scene in the Maltese islands, whether bouldering, traditional leading, sport climbing, alpinism or mountaineering. If you’ve climbed or want to know about climbing in Malta, this club is for you. We promote the sport at a national level, develop international relations, organise climbing-related activities and represent climbers on access issues, amongst other roles.
