This surname first features in the Status Animarum (diocesan census) of Malta of 1687 though most likely pre-dates that initial recording by as much as two centuries.



Similar to the surname Delia, this surname most likely derives from the Italian given name Elia. Itself derived from the Hebrew biblical name Elijah, meaning “My God is Yahweh”.



An arm holding tools is a symbol of diligent work and industriousness, The fes in or (gold/yellow), a tincture that represents success, further echos this.
