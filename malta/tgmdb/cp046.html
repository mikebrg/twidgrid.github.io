The areas of Qawra and Bugibba, in Saint Paul's Bay, have seen rapid development in the population. This area was in the hands of the community of the Conventual Franciscan Friars of Saint Paul's Bay. The mass for the residents and summer people was held in the small church of Saint Maximilian and other chapels. The idea of ​​building a bigger church had been brewing in the minds of the ecclesiastical authorities. On the 29th of August 1993 the blessing of the first stone of the new church took place, and three years later, in the summer of 1996, although not completely finished, masses began to be held in the new church . The church, on a plan by Architect Richard England, is dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi and is run by the Conventual Franciscan Friars. By a decree of 8 December 2004, Qawra was declared a parish dedicated to Stigmata of St. Francis of Assisi.
