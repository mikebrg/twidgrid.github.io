Temple Period
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
Between 3600 BC and 2500 BC, Malta experienced the remarkable Temple Period, a golden age of prehistoric achievement. This era is defined by the construction of megalithic temples, some of the oldest free-standing structures in the world. Sites like Ħaġar Qim, Mnajdra, and Ġgantija showcase advanced architectural and engineering skills, with intricately carved stonework and astronomical alignments. These temples, believed to be centers of spiritual and communal life, reflect a sophisticated society deeply connected to nature and ritual. The Temple Period stands as a testament to Malta's early cultural and artistic significance.
