The parish church of Saint George, just off the main square It-Tokk, is situated in the very centre of the old town. The parish originated in medieval times, definitely before 1450, when it is recorded functioning as a parish church. The foundation stone of the present church was laid on 7 August 1672. It was consecrated on 21 September 1755. On 6 September 1958, the church was bestowed the title of Basilica. It became a Archipresbyteral and Collegiate Church aggregated to the Cathedral-Basilica of Saint John Lateran, Rome, on 8 December 1976.
