French Occupation
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
Between 1798 and 1800, Malta was under French occupation, following Napoleon Bonaparte's arrival on the island in June 1798. The French took control from the Knights of St. John, who had governed Malta for centuries. However, the occupation was marked by unrest and resistance from the Maltese population, who resented the French reforms and harsh rule. By 1800, following a siege and military support from the British, the French forces surrendered, and Malta was handed over to British control. This brief but tumultuous period played a pivotal role in Malta's eventual integration into the British Empire.
