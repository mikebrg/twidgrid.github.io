On the 9th of September 1913, Birżebbuġa became a parish and the small Church of Our Lady of Sorrows became the Parish Church, but as it was too small, work immediately began to build a bigger church.  The new church, dedicated to St. Peter in Chains, was opened for worship on June 16, 1938, although the building work was not yet completely finished.
