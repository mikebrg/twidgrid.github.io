Between 1800 and 1919, Malta was a British colony, a strategic naval base in the Mediterranean. Following the French occupation from 1798 to 1800, the British took control of the island, using it as a crucial outpost during the Napoleonic Wars. Malta's role as a naval hub was solidified throughout the 19th century, with the British constructing fortifications and expanding the island’s infrastructure. The British also introduced significant social, economic, and political changes. In the early 20th century, the island became increasingly important during World War I, serving as a critical base for military operations in the Mediterranean. However, despite its strategic significance, many Maltese people began to push for greater self-governance, setting the stage for the island's eventual move towards independence.
