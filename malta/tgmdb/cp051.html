For a long time, Ħal Safi was part of the parish of Bir Miftuh and a small chapel dedicated to the Conversion of Saint Paul was definitely built before 1564. Bishop Tumas Gargallo chose this church to be the parish church from among other small churches in the village and established it as a parish on April 13, 1598. The building of the present church, in Doric style, began in 1726 , during the time of the priest Joseph Caruana and was completed in 1740. Bishop Vincenzo Labini consecrated the church on 10 October 1784.
