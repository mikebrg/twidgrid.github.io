Gina, together with her young daughter Anna, returns to a village, which is home to several haunting childhood memories. She seeks revenge over those who abused her past, and throughout the course of this, destroys the tranquility and peace of her fellow villagers. Why are all the locals troubled at Gina's return? Why are they hiding a common secret, which if revealed could wreck so many others...anyone of them could be Anna's father.
