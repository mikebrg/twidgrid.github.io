Imġiebaħ Bay is an unspoiled beach located in the north of Malta, very close to Selmun. It’s difficult to get to and requires beach goers to trek down the cliff face before rewarding them with its scenic views. Due to its secluded nature, the beach is good for camping, dog walking, barbecuing and the occasional party. There is a winding road which takes you through the scenic valley to this golden sandy beach and crystal clear water. It is off the beaten track and frequented by a few locals and also by tourists who are given directions to this beach. It is not easily reached by cars and parking space is very limited.
