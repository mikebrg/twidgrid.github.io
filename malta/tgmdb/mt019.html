Ancient Temple in Malta. The ruinous and probable remains of a Chalcolithic temple. It has never been excavated and although now preserved against further agricultural encroachment (although not by smilax and prickly pears!) the site has been extensively cultivated and it is inevitable that a large amount of contemporary material will have been lost.
