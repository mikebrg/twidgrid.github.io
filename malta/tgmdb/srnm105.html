First recorded in Malta in the year 1575 but was probably found on the islands up to a century earlier.



Potentially derived from the surname Tanto, from the Italian word meaning “abundance, many”. Another potential source is the surname Tanzi, a shortening of the name Costanzo, itself from the latin constantius, meaning “steadfast, faithful, resolute”.



The azure (blue) chevron on this coat of arms represents roof, shelter, and protection, whilst the rooster symbolises vigilance, strength, and pride. The field in or (gold/yellow) represents nobility, prestige and success.
