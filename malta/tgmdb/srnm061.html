First seen in a 1299 will mentioning a Phylippo Falzono, the family enjoyed a high-ranking feudal position throughout the late Middle Ages.



From the Italian surname Falzone, itself from the Italian falso meaning "false, deceitful, hypocritical". It may come from falcone meaning falcon, referring to "one who is agile and light".



The stylized anvil, a rarity in heraldry, denotes honour. Flowers are symbols of hope and love that, when in triplicate, are aimed toward the Holy Trinity.
