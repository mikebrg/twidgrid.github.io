Ħondoq ir-Rummien, the coastline below the village of Qala, Gozo, Malta is dotted with traditional salt pans, some of which are still actively used to harvest salt throughout the summer months. On this coast is a small cove, Ħondoq ir-Rummien (which in English means, Pomegranate Moat), which is used by snorkelers because of its deep and clear water and the small caves at sea level. Access to the sea is from bathing ladders. The cove has a view of Comino. There is also a small white sand beach sheltered by a small promontory on the southwest side.
