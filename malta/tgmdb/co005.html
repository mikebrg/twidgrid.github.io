Christian Life Communities

The Christian Life Community is an international lay movement of men and women, young and adult, from all types of background, who desire to live more closely with Jesus Christ and participate in His mission. In this we follow the Way of St. Ignatius of Loyola. Members gather regularly in small groups to support one another in living a way of life based on Gospel values. The small communities are organised into larger communities regionally and nationally, together forming the World Community. At present, in Malta and Gozo, there are some two hundred and seventy CLC members, mostly young adults, who meet on a regular basis in about twenty-three different communities, each with its own character and history. An elected Leadership Community serves as a link between the local communities as well as the international movement; it provides direction and co-ordinates sharing of resources.
