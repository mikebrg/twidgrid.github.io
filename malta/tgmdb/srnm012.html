Dating back to at least the Late Middle Ages we find, amongst others, Vincenti Bartolu listed on the Militia Roster of 1417.



This surname could be a shortened version of the Italian given name Bartolomeo, which itself comes from the Aramaic Bartalmay meaning "Son of Talmay" and, whilst uncertain, may mean "suspender of the waters" or "furrow". It could also relate to the Arabic burtul, which refers to a Bishop's mitre.



Both the book and the cross couped (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the shield) on this coat of arms are representations of the Chirstian faith.
