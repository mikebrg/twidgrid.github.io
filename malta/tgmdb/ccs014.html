St Dorothy’s Senior School is a girls’ school, with a student roll of around four hundred, and a teaching complement of about sixty. There are eighteen classes although for a number of subjects, the students are divided into smaller groups. The Mission Statement of the school emphasises the charism of St Paula Frassinetti, who wanted the uniqueness of every child to be appreciated, with special care and attention being given to those who are facing any type of poverty. St Dorothy's Senior School forms part of a worldwide network of Dorothean educational institutions and a college of three Maltese schools.
