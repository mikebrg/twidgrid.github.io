Qormi is one of the parishes that already existed in 1436. Twenty years after this date another church was built with the efforts of the priest Don Julju Lombardi and in 1584 the church that is there today was built. In 1680 the dome was built and in 1684 the bell towers were added. On June 30, 2019, Archbishop Charles J. Scicluna raised this church to the dignity of Collegiate.
