Siġġiewi has been a parish since before 1436 but all that is left of the old church is a part of a chapel. The church that is there today began to be built in 1675 based on a design by Lorenzo Gafà and was completed thirteen years later. It was dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Bari. In 1862 it was enlarged based on a design by Dr. Nikola Zammit.
