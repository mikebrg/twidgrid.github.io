The Dominican Church in Valletta became the main parish and matrix of the same city by Pope Saint Pius V with the Apostolic Seal Ex Debito Pastoralis of 2 July 1571. The original church, built by Glormu Cassar, had to be demolished 200 years later due to the many damages caused by the earthquake of 1693. It became a Minor Basilica in 1816. The new church was consecrated on 15 October 1889.
