This documentary on DVD deals with the harsh realities of World War II as seen in the eyes of a child who recalls hardships, poverty, friendships and death. Shot in several period key locations in Malta intertwined with real World War II footage, Malta George Cross reveals this perspective within a historical context coloured with a human touch. The director and the school hope that the audience manages to teleport back to the forties guided all the way with the help of this child who now passionately recalls every single detail.
