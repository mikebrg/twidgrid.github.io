We first see this surname documented in Malta on the Militia Roster of 1417 as Haxis(c)a, Haxixa/e and Chaxixe amongst others.



This surname could originate from the Old Italian assisa. This could refer to either a collector of tax or excise duty or a designate of the local lord tasked with informing their subjects of a new tax, making this an occupational name.



It may also come from the Siculo-Arabic hashish, referring to grass, seaweed, or simply vegetables, and indeed an alternate coat of arms for this surname features a more agricultural theme.
