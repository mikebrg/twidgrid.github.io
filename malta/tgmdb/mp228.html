Notary Philip Saliba was one of the last four former members of Parliament who witnessed the whole process of Malta’s Independence in 1964.<p>He was the first Żebbuġi to contest the general election under the umbrella of the Nationalist Party in 1953. He was proud to have known former prime ministers Nerik Mizzi and George Borg Oliver and was an honest and exemplary politician respected by both sides of the House and by his adversaries.<p>He was elected in two other subsequent elections, that of 1962 in which he obtained the highest number of votes among all the contesting candidates in the fifth district, and in the first post independence election in 1966.<p>He served as a deputy speaker in these two legislatures and headed various delegations of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, on the occasion of Botswana Independence and as far as China.<p>His profession brought him close to his constituents and I still recall his ability to know almost all the villagers’ names and surnames and not least their nicknames.<p>Notary Saliba carried out his profession in a very professional and efficient manner. The number of clients from all walks of life from within his constituency and afar is proof of his integrity.
