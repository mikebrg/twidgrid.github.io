There are many amateurs and other professionals who, by September, are preparing to start making cribs. Massimo Borg is one of these. We went to the warehouse of the Basilica of Saint Helena in B'Kara where Massimo was building a new crib for the Basilica. Marthese Brincat asked him questions about what he used to build a large crib and other interesting questions while he himself was doing some work on it.
