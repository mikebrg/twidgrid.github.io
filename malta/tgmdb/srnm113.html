Listed as Zarafa/i, Zirafa, Zirofa and Zurafa/e, this surname can be found on the Militia Roster of 1417.



Almost certainly of Arabic origin, it could originate from zarâfah, meaning “giraffe”, and referring to a tall or long-necked person, or from the name Zarîfa, which means “pretty, gracious, smart” and itself from the Arabic word zarfmeaning “courtesy, elegance”.



Whilst no giraffes are featured on this coat of arms, it does incorporate a circular ordinary known as an annulet, in or (gold/yellow), and a symbol of fidelity, chivalry and trust.
