The Chapel of St Anthony of Padua (Maltese: Kappella ta' Sant'Antnin ta' Padova) is a Roman Catholic chapel located in Fort Manoel on Manoel Island in Gżira, Malta. It was completed in 1727 as an integral part of the fort, and it was partially destroyed by aerial bombardment in 1942 during World War II. The chapel was reconstructed as part of a restoration project and it was completed in 2009.
