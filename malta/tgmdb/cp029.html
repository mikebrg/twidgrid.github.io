In 1497 in Luqa there was already a chapel dedicated to Saint Andrew. Instead of this chapel, between 1539 and 1542, a church was built which then became a parish on 15 June 1634. Shortly after, with the efforts of the first priest, a new church was built which was completed in 1686. Between 1693 and 1737 a new choir and a new facade with two bell towers were built and on 7 December 1783 the church was consecrated by Bishop Labini. Between 1901 and 1910 the naves were added but then, on 9 April 1942, the church was destroyed by bombs. It was rebuilt bigger and more beautiful between 1945 and 1954 and was consecrated by Archbishop Gonzi on 26 September 1962.
