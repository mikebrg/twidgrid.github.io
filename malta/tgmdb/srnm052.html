This surname was first recorded in 1417 on the Militia Roster as Dibonu.



Italian in origin, buono, or bono means 'good, good-natured, pious, virtuous'. In Latin, bonus represents 'good, kind, brave, loyal, lucky.' As potentially seen with the surnames Pace and Aquilina amongst others, there is a chance this surname was created by directly translating the Arabic name Tajjib.



Three mullets of six points represent the family's Christian faith whilst the tree means power. The 'wildman', popular in German heraldry, denotes a long lineage, heritage and love for one's country.
