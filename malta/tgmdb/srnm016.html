One of the earliest known records of this surname relates to a Giacomo Bunnice who relocated to Gozo from Florence in 1356.



Italian in origin, it is most likely derived from the surnames Boncini, Baroncio and Bonichis. Other potential sources include the Italian names Bon(a)mico (from buon(o) amico, meaning "worthy friend" or Bondici, Bendice, from the Latin benedice meaning "blessing".



Swords in heraldry signify power, freedom and military honour. The gules (red) field represents courage and fortitude as well as patience and sacrifice.
