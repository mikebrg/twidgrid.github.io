Rinella Bay is the only bay located in the harbour area. It is only a few meters away from the nearest bus stop and is easily accessed on foot from Rinella Street or St Rokku Street. This bay is made of three elements, one can find a quiet quay on the left side with a free for all shower at one end, a sandy beach in the middle and a rocky area on the right side which is dog friendly. There is a newly built public convenience, three restaurants and take-aways one can visit along the bay.
