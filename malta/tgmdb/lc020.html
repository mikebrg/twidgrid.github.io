Isla Local Council
" class="mtimage"><p class="mttext">
The Local Council of Isla, also known as Senglea, is one of the smallest and most historic councils in Malta. Situated in the southeastern part of the island within the Grand Harbour area, Isla is part of the renowned "Three Cities" alongside Vittoriosa and Cospicua. Known for its rich history, Isla played a crucial role in the Great Siege of 1565 and was later heavily impacted during World War II due to its strategic location. Today, the council oversees the preservation of Isla’s historical sites, such as the Gardjola Gardens and the Senglea Basilica, while promoting cultural events and supporting the local community. The area offers a blend of Maltese heritage and picturesque sea views, drawing both locals and visitors to its charming streets and historic waterfront.
