St Philip’s church which is found in Vittoriosa is dedicated to St Philip Neri who was an Italian priest that founded the Oratory in Italy and in other countries. In 1624, Fr Ġwann Abela built a church dedicated to St Mary of the Angels. In 1653 the church was placed under the responsibility of the congregation of St Philip Neri. Consequently, the name of the church St Mary of the Angels changed into St Philip’s church.
