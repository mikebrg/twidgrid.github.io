Open day and night, with the Blessed Sacrament permanently exposed it provides solace to many a lost soul.  But the unique pastoral approach of this project is the fact that it caters not only for the soul but also for the body.  The Millennium Chapel/Wow has a twinning agreement with two significant institutions : The St. Clare Cloister Nuns Monastery and The Youth Football Association.  The former to join in prayer as  no less than three nuns found their vocations by frequenting the Chapel before they entered the Cloister Monastery and the latter, to promote the value of the body and the material world created by God  through  the sports values.
