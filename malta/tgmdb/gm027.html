Francisco Ximénez de Tejada y Eslava (Aragonese: Francisco Ximénes de Texada i Eslava; 13 October 1703, Funes, Kingdom of Navarre − 9 November 1775, Naples) was a Spanish knight who served as the 69th Prince and Grand Master of the Order of Malta from 1773 to 1775. During his reign the Order became unpopular mainly due to bankruptcy brought by the lavish lifestyle of his predecessor Manuel Pinto da Fonseca. His reign was marked by the unsuccessful Rising of the Priests.
