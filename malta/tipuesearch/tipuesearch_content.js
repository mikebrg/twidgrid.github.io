Members come from all walks of life, and it is a firm view of the community that no distinction based on status or class should be allowed to hold sway within the group. Through the years which have passed since the community’s formation, various teachers, nurses, labourers, accountants, soldiers, and administrative officials, have together contributed to create a sense of vibrant and honest friendship. While the group is primarily intentioned for single people, many couples have counted among its members over the years. The CSC holds its meetings every Tuesday at its Floriana premises. While many of the meetings are of a spiritual character, meetings are also held about subjects of general interest, like psychology, art, health, and personal development. The meetings are often animated by powerpoint presentations. Weekend activities vary, and include cultural visits, birthday parties, eating out, and attendance of concerts and performances.

The construction of the Garrison Chapel came about as a result of the confluence of a number of factors. During this period the British Imperial Government embarked on a programme of building a number of schools throughout the British Empire aimed at the education not only of the children of military and naval personnel but also for the instruction of soldiers and sailors themselves, who, at that time, were largely uneducated. Similar buildings were in fact built throughout the British Empire including the Indian sub-continent. In the mid-1850s Malta was already under British rule and its strategic position particularly as a naval base, had already been recognised. Around this time, Queen Adelaide, consort to King William IV and a very devout lady, during a visit to Malta, expressed her concern that the troops in Malta did not have a place of worship of their own and encouraged the building of a Church for this use. Indeed, while military and naval activity on the Island during that time was considerable, there was no multi-denominational or Anglican Church in Malta. Numerous military and naval personnel were stationed on the Island or passed through as the British navy and military crossed the Empire. The outbreak of the Crimean War in 1853 resulted in significantly more troop traffic through the Grand Harbour and its surrounding areas further increasing the number of troops and their families needing to be educated. Interestingly, therefore, the Garrison Chapel was planned and built to be used for a dual purpose. During the week it was used as a school, while on Sunday’s it was used as a multi-denominational place of worship.
