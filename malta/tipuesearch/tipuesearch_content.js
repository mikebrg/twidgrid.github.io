In 1935, Major Bertram Ede, one of Vernon Kell's MI5 operatives 'reported adversely on the pro-Italian sympathies of the Chief Justice, Sir Arturo Mercieca, but although these led to Mercieca's arrest and detention in Uganda during the Second World War, no action was taken against him in 1935'.

As “one of the most eminent advocates at the Bar”, he was appointed Crown Advocate (today’s Attorney General) by the Governor on 27 October 1842.  As such, apart from being the Government’s legal adviser, he defended its civil lawsuits, prosecuted offenders before the Criminal Court or the Court of Special Commission sitting with a Jury, and drafted legislation which he then piloted in the Council of Government, notably the Criminal Code, the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure, and the Commercial Code. Between 1829 and 1842 he recorded the judgements delivered in the courts of first and second instance, and published with copious annotations those dated 1839-1849, some time before the official Collezione di Decisioni dei Tribunali di Malta started in 1858.  Dr Micallef was the most prolific Maltese author of legal works in the 19th century.  They include a collection of judgements given by the Supremo Magistrato di Giustizia and the following books: Trattato delle procedure civili nel foro di Malta (1839) and Compendio dè Diritto Commerciale secondo i principii di giurisprudenza Maltese (1841).  He also published Annotazioni to Sir I. G. Bonavita’s Raccolta delle leggi di procedura (1841) and to the Code de Rohan (2 vols. 1841-1843).  His Osservazioni (21 September 1844) on Mr Andrew Jameson’s report on the draft Criminal Code of 1842 were never published.  A couple of his manuscripts still extant are in the collection of Dr. Albert Ganado. In 1841 Dr Micallef was nominated to the General Council of the University and to the Special Council of the Faculty of Laws.  In 1848 he was appointed member of the commission formed to draw up a Commercial Code.  On 1 January 1854 he became one of Her Majesty’s Judges, raised to President of the Court of Appeal on 1 July 1859, and ex officio Judge of the Vice-Admiralty Court.  Invested Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) on 27 July 1860, and promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) in 1879.  In that year, he prepared a lengthy report on the civil laws of Malta for Prince Bismarck at the request of the local government. Being a septuagenarian he tendered his resignation from the Bench in September 1879, but it was only accepted on 2 November 1880 with a pension of ₤600 per annum, the amount of his salary, in recognition of his excellent services.  Of all the Presidents of the Court of Appeal, his was the longest term of service, lasting twenty-one years and four months.  In January 1881 he was elected to the Council of Government where he proposed several measures, including the merging of the Commercial Court with the Civil Court.  He passed away on 5 April 1889 at his last residence, 6 Strada Doni, Rabat, and was interred in the family tomb at the Parish Church of Casal Balzan.  A memorial tablet was erected in his honour at the Addolarata Cemetery.  His wife Francesca Xerri died in December 1847 at the age of 33, leaving six children.

His role was to serve as the legal adviser to the government and as ex officio General Magistrate. During his tenure, he was assisted by Dr. Emanuele Caruana and Dr. Benedetto Bardon, who were appointed King’s Counsels for the Island of Malta and its dependencies, and by Dr. Odoardo Dingli, who was appointed King’s Counsel for the Island of Gozo. However, his office was short-lived, as in 1838, following a report by a Royal Commission investigating the judicial establishment of Malta, the British government abolished the Office altogether. Subsequently, by Proclamation No. I of 1839, the Office of the Attorney General was replaced with the Office of the Crown Advocate. <p>A Controversial Figure<p>Langslow's time in Malta was marked by controversy. He was involved in drafting new codes for Malta, leading commissions composed of Maltese and British jurists. However, he opposed the Maltese preference to model the codes on the new ones of the Two Sicilies, favoring the English version instead. This opposition led to a stalemate in the work of the commissions. His contentious behavior extended to personal matters; he was criticized for protecting his son's criminal behavior, which led to strong criticism from Governor Bouverie and the eventual abolition of his office. <p>From Malta to Ceylon<p>After leaving Malta under a cloud, Langslow sought employment in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) as a judge. There, his legal trajectory mirrored his previous one in Malta. He made enemies everywhere with his turbulent and bizarre behavior, starting with his advertisement in the newspapers shortly after his appointment, selling his legal library “solely because the owner has now ascertained that he cannot any longer afford, out of the small salary paid to him as a judge, to keep up a law library” for the service of the government and the public. This advertisement raised a public uproar. He continued to clash with colleagues and the judiciary, reacting to a disagreement with the Attorney General by locking up all the court files and suspending court sittings indefinitely. His tenure ended when he publicly criticized the Supreme Court judges who had acquitted a lieutenant he had sentenced, leading to his removal from office. <p>Legacy<p>Today, Robert Langslow is a footnote in Maltese legal history. His tenure as Attorney General was short and fraught with controversy, and his subsequent actions in Ceylon further tarnished his reputation. While his name may not be widely recognized, his story serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges faced by legal professionals in colonial administrations.

This appointment is still held every year, on the eve of the festival at around 1.00 p.m. This was not the only appointment with the emigrants. In fact, every year several emigrants contact us, both through phone calls and even through email to convey their congratulations to their relatives who live in Gozo.

Armed with only an Amiga computer (8 bit sound, only 4 voice polyphonic and 1 megabyte of ram), an old 4 track, a cheap reverb box and a microphone, he set out to make these two intense areas of music converge into one style. And attempt to cope with the ratio of a ton of ideas to a very restricted audio setup. The earliest Apotheosis material was quite primitive. It hovered more along the ambient zone with textures and passages derived from the cryptic and cold realms of Black Metal. After a year of experimentation, the material recorded was clearly showing the evolution of this project, from rudimentary ambient passages to properly organised guitars, to vocals.

Both amateur guitarists, their influences in bands such as Venom, Bathory and Slayer pathed the way in experimenting guitar techniques and riffing. Music patterns were born, oriental and dark and their partnership in music grew deeper. Their fellow collegues being both novices in playing drums and bass, never advanced, leaving no choice but to recruit other members. Dino joined on drums. Now being a four piece with Will 'Grizzly' (Norm Rejection vocalist) on keyboards. The remaining place on bass was taken by Rex. His music mastery enhanced what Michael and Carlo created, thus making Lithomancy an athmospherical death metal band with touches of black metal. Mike also took the vocal role, lyrics dealing in egyptology and occult which also complimented their music. Tracks like ‘The Neophyte Ceremony’, ‘Osiris On-Nophris’ and ‘Madame Zarathusera’ were the source for moshpits during their first appearance at the 'Rock for the Fort' held at the Rinella Fort in 1995. Hailed as one of the promising bands, Lithomancy took part in the ‘Lobotomy’ gig held at the White Rocks complex in early 1996.

While many of the meetings are of a spiritual character, meetings are also held about subjects of general interest, like psychology, art, health, and personal development.

The construction of the Garrison Chapel came about as a result of the confluence of a number of factors. During this period the British Imperial Government embarked on a programme of building a number of schools throughout the British Empire aimed at the education not only of the children of military and naval personnel but also for the instruction of soldiers and sailors themselves, who, at that time, were largely uneducated. Similar buildings were in fact built throughout the British Empire including the Indian sub-continent. In the mid-1850s Malta was already under British rule and its strategic position particularly as a naval base, had already been recognised. Around this time, Queen Adelaide, consort to King William IV and a very devout lady, during a visit to Malta, expressed her concern that the troops in Malta did not have a place of worship of their own and encouraged the building of a Church for this use. Indeed, while military and naval activity on the Island during that time was considerable, there was no multi-denominational or Anglican Church in Malta. Numerous military and naval personnel were stationed on the Island or passed through as the British navy and military crossed the Empire. The outbreak of the Crimean War in 1853 resulted in significantly more troop traffic through the Grand Harbour and its surrounding areas further increasing the number of troops and their families needing to be educated. Interestingly, therefore, the Garrison Chapel was planned and built to be used for a dual purpose. During the week it was used as a school, while on Sunday’s it was used as a multi-denominational place of worship.
