<br>
<br><strong>Early life and education
</strong><br>Marsan was born on 9 June 1968 in the Stepney district of London, to a working-class family; his father was a lorry driver and his mother was a school dinner lady and teacher's assistant. He was brought up in Bethnal Green and attended Raine's Foundation School. He left school at 16 and initially served an apprenticeship as a printer before beginning his career in theatre.
<br>
<br>He trained at the Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, graduating in 1991, and went on to study under Sam Kogan at the Kogan Academy of Dramatic Arts, now known as The School of the Science of Acting, of which Marsan is now a patron. His first year at drama school was funded by Mr Benny, a bookmaker who ran a menswear shop where Marsan worked; he obtained scholarships for the rest of the course. It took many attempts for Marsan to get a place at drama school.
<br>
<br><strong>Career</strong><br>Marsan's first television appearance was in 1992, as a "yob" in the London Weekend Television series The Piglet Files. One of his more significant early television appearances was in the popular mid-1990s BBC sitcom Game On as an escaped convict who was an old flame of Mandy's. Marsan went on to have roles in Casualty, The Bill, Grass, Kavanagh QC, Grange Hill, Silent Witness, Ultimate Force, Southcliffe, and more. He also voiced the Manticore in the Merlin episode "Love in the Time of Dragons".
<br>
<br>In 2011, he starred alongside Olivia Colman and Peter Mullan, all three actors relatively unknown at that time, in the British drama film Tyrannosaur.
<br>
<br>In 2013, he began portraying Terry Donovan, brother to the lead character in 7 series and 82 episodes of Showtime's drama series Ray Donovan. The same year he played Ludwig Guttmann in the television film The Best of Men. In May 2015, Marsan appeared as the practical magician Gilbert Norrell in the BBC period drama Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell.
<br>
<br>Marsan has appeared in numerous and varied film roles. His roles include the main villain in the 2008 superhero film Hancock alongside Will Smith and as Inspector Lestrade in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes. His other films include Sixty Six, Gangs of New York, 21 Grams, The Illusionist, V for Vendetta, Gangster No. 1, Miami Vice, Mission: Impossible III, I Want Candy, Vera Drake, Happy-Go-Lucky, Filth, Tyrannosaur and Heartless.
<br>
<br>In 2021, Marsan appeared as anti-Fascist activist Soly Malinovsky in the television adaptation of the novel Ridley Road. In 2022, he played the real-life role of John Darwin in ITV's drama series The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe.
<br>
<br>Marsan appeared as Mitch Winehouse, father of Amy Winehouse, in the biopic Back to Black, which was released in 2024.
<br>
<br><strong>Personal life
<br></strong>Marsan married make-up artist Janine Schneider in 2002. They have four children. Marsan is a humanist and was appointed a patron of Humanists UK in 2015. He is critical of the lack of representation of working-class people in the arts in 2015 on BBC Radio 5 Live in which he stated too much drama is written from "the white, privileged, middle class perspective". In 2024 he was interviewed on HARDtalk with an episode entitled <em>Do the arts neglect working-class people?</em>.<br><br><strong><br></strong></p>

She gained popularity for starring in the Argentine Nickelodeon teen sitcom SueÃ±a conmigo (2010â€“2011). As a singer, she released the albums Contracorriente (2009) and Te AcordarÃ¡s de MÃ­ (2012).
<br>

In 2024, she starred in the science fiction series 3 Body Problem and the spy action-comedy film The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.
<br>
<br><strong>Early life and education
</strong><br>GonzÃ¡lez was born on 30 January 1990 in Caborca, Sonora, Mexico, the only daughter of former model Glenda Reyna and Carlos GonzÃ¡lez. Her father died in a motorcycle accident when she was 12; she has cited her father's death as a strong influence in her career. She has one brother who is 12 years her senior.
<br>
<br>She attended two private bilingual schools, Edron Academy and the American School Foundation, both located in Mexico City. She stayed in Trento, Italy, where she has relatives, for some time when she was around 10, to learn Italian.
<br>
<br>From 2003 through 2004, GonzÃ¡lez studied acting at the M&amp;M Studio, an acting school in Mexico City run by actress Patricia Reyes SpÃ­ndola. She completed two years of a three-year course at Televisa's acting school, Centro de EducaciÃ³n ArtÃ­stica, before she was cast as the protagonist in the 2007 teen-oriented telenovela Lola...Ã‰rase una vez at the age of 16.
<br>
<br><strong>Career</strong><br>
While attending school, she was first spotted by producer and director, Pedro DamiÃ¡n, best known for his success with Latin pop band RBD. Two years later, Damian cast GonzÃ¡lez in a remake of Argentina's famous children's telenovela, Floricienta. She portrayed Lola Valente, the lead female protagonist in Lola, Ã©rase una vez. The show began filming in late 2006, and debuted in Mexico on 26 February 2007. It was later shown in various countries throughout Latin America and the United States. Following the completion of Lola, Ã©rase una vez, GonzÃ¡lez, accompanied by her mother, moved to New York City briefly in the spring of 2008 to attend a three-month course of acting classes at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. She returned to Mexico City in early fall of that same year.
<br>
<br>In April 2009, she was cast in an episode of the popular crime drama television series Mujeres Asesinas as a supporting character for the second season. She starred alongside Mexican actress Susana GonzÃ¡lez in the episode "Tere, Desconfiada", playing the teenage antagonist, Gaby. GonzÃ¡lez has said that she was told about the casting call while she was preparing to release her first solo album Contracorriente.
<br>
<br>In 2010, Nickelodeon announced that GonzÃ¡lez would be starring in teen sitcom SueÃ±a conmigo, where she played the characters of Clara Molina and Roxy Pop. For the role, GonzÃ¡lez traveled to Buenos Aires to film in April 2010. She lived in Buenos Aires for a year, traveling back to Mexico City on breaks during the production of the series. When filming ended in February 2011, Gonzalez returned to Mexico City. The show was produced by Nickelodeon and Televisa, and aired on 20 July 2010 in Latin America and Europe. Because of its success in Argentina, the cast performed several concerts in cities in that country from March to July 2011.
<br>
<br>In 2012, GonzÃ¡lez filmed Casi 30, a comedy-drama directed by Alejandro Sugich. GonzÃ¡lez plays Cristina, an 18-year-old ballet student who falls in love with Emilio, the film's lead character. The film marks GonzÃ¡lez's acting debut in cinema. In 2013, the movie premiered at several film festivals in Mexico, but it premiered nationwide in Mexico on 22 August 2014.
<br>
<br>In 2012, GonzÃ¡lez starred in the Televisa series Amores verdaderos, a remake of the TV Azteca television series Amor en custodia. The show premiered on 3 September 2012. Originally, Mexican producer Pedro Torres offered GonzÃ¡lez the lead role of SofÃ­a LÃ³pez-Haro in his television show, Gossip Girl: Acapulco, the Mexican remake of the hit American television series, Gossip Girl. GonzÃ¡lez considered accepting the role, but declined, due to her rigorous filming schedule for Amores verdaderos.
<br>
<br>In late August 2013, GonzÃ¡lez moved to Los Angeles to pursue her acting career. In September 2013, GonzÃ¡lez was cast in director Adrian Cervantes' film, All Hail the Squash Blossom Queen. The film was slated to star Bonnie Wright of the Harry Potter film franchise, and GonzÃ¡lez was expected to play Brittany in the movie, but she was later dropped from the project when the role was recast in 2015.
<br>
<br>In November 2013, GonzÃ¡lez was announced as a cast member for producer Robert Rodriguez's television series, From Dusk till Dawn: The Series. GonzÃ¡lez played Santanico Pandemonium, a role portrayed by Salma Hayek in the original film. The role was GonzÃ¡lez's first English-speaking part, and she also featured prominently in print advertisements for the series. The show was produced by Rodriguez for his El Rey network. GonzÃ¡lez relocated to Austin, Texas, to film the program's first season. Following its U.S. debut, the show became available for streaming internationally on Netflix in the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Latin America. On 26 March 2014, the series was renewed for a second season on El Rey.
<br>
<br>On 12 August 2014, she hosted the MTV Millennial Awards at the World Trade Center Mexico City in Mexico City. In March 2015, GonzÃ¡lez and the cast of From Dusk till Dawn: The Series returned to Austin, Texas, to begin filming for the show's second season.

The album was released in Mexico on 24 November 2009. It was released in the US on 26 January 2010. The album's only single, "Mi destino soy yo" was released in Mexico on 20 October 2009. To promote the single, she performed at televised music festivals and concerts across Mexico. Because of the SueÃ±a conmigo musical tour in Argentina, GonzÃ¡lez was unable to embark on a longer tour for the album or release a second single.
<br>
<br>In June 2011, GonzÃ¡lez announced that she wished to focus on the production and recording of her second solo album. She also revealed that she planned to spend the remainder of the year working on new music and would not return to film or television projects until the album was completed. She completed production on her second album during the first months of 2012. The album was recorded in Mexico City, Texas and the Dominican Republic.

                               <strong><br></strong>Eva de la Caridad MÃ©ndez (born March 5, 1974), known professionally as Eva Mendes, is an American actress. Her acting career began in the late 1990s with a series of roles in films such as Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror (1998) and Urban Legends: Final Cut (2000).
<br>
<br>Mendes's performance in Training Day (2001) marked a turning point in her career and led to parts in the commercially successful films 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and Hitch (2005). She starred in Ghost Rider (2007) and The Spirit (2008), both film adaptations of comics, and ventured into more dramatic territory with We Own the Night (2007), Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009), Last Night (2010), and The Place Beyond the Pines (2012). Her other films include Out of Time (2003), The Women (2008), The Other Guys (2010), and Girl in Progress (2012).
<br>
<br>Mendes has appeared in several music videos for artists such as Will Smith and has also been an ambassador for brands including Calvin Klein, Cartier, Reebok, Pantene shampoo, Morgan and Peek &amp; Cloppenburg. She has designed for New York &amp; Company and is the creative director of CIRCA Beauty, a makeup line sold at Walgreens. She has been in a relationship with Canadian actor Ryan Gosling since 2011, and they have two daughters.
<br>
<br><strong>Early life
<br></strong>Mendes was born on March 5, 1974, in Miami, Florida, to Cuban parents Eva PÃ©rez SuÃ¡rez and Juan Carlos MÃ©ndez and was raised by her mother in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Silver Lake after her parents' divorce. Her mother worked at Mann's Chinese Theatre and later for an aerospace company, and her father ran a meat distribution business. Mendes had one older brother Juan Carlos MÃ©ndez Jr. (1963â€“2016), who died from throat cancer. She attended Hoover High School in Glendale and later studied marketing at California State University, Northridge, but left college to pursue acting under Ivana Chubbuck.
<br>
<br><strong>Acting career
<br></strong>Beginnings and breakthrough (1998â€“2001)
<br>Mendes started her acting career after a talent manager saw her photograph in a friend's portfolio. Her first film role was as part of a group of young people who become lost in middle America in the direct-to-video horror film Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror. Mendes was disappointed in her performance and soon hired an acting coach. She subsequently took on the roles of a bridesmaid in the comedy A Night at the Roxbury (1998) with Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan, a housekeeper in the fantasy family film My Brother the Pig (1999) with Scarlett Johansson, and an ill-fated film student in the slasher film Urban Legends: Final Cut (2000).
<br>
<br>Mendes appeared in the Steven Seagal action thriller Exit Wounds (2001), which made over US$73 million worldwide. According to Mendes, her voice was dubbed in the editing after a producer told her she "didn't sound intelligent enough". Her breakthrough came later in 2001 with her performance as the mistress of a corrupt cop in Antoine Fuqua's crime thriller Training Day alongside Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. She described her role as pivotal in her career, motivating her to keep going as an actress after she had become bored doing "terrible, cheesy horrible films." Training Day was a box office hit, grossing US$104.5 million.
<br>
<br><strong>Worldwide exposure (2002â€“2009)</strong><br>Her role in Training Day led to larger film parts and Mendes soon established herself as a Hollywood actress. While her sole film release in 2002 was the crime comedy All About the Benjamins, in which she played the girlfriend of a con artist, Mendes had roles in four studio feature films released throughout 2003. 2 Fast 2 Furious teamed her with Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson while portraying a United States Customs Service agent working undercover for a notorious Argentine drug lord. The film gave Mendes much wider exposure, grossing over US$236 million globally. The Western action film Once Upon a Time in Mexico saw her star as the daughter of a Mexican drug lord, alongside Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. While reviews for the film were mixed, it made US$98.1 million.
<br>
<br>Mendes reunited with Denzel Washington for the thriller Out of Time, in which she played the soon-to-be ex-wife of a well-respected chief of police. The film was a moderate commercial success, and Roger Ebert, in his review for the film, described Mendes' role as a "curiously forgiving character, who feels little rancor for the straying [husband] and apparently still likes him; maybe there would have been more suspense if she were furious with him". Her last 2003 film was the comedy Stuck on You, with Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear, in which she played an aspiring actress.
<br>
<br>She starred as the love interest of a professional dating consultant (Will Smith), in her next film, Hitch (2005), USA Today described it as "her best screen role to date", and Detroit Free Press remarked: "Smith and Mendes are terrific together. He brings her game up so high you'd think she has had as many good parts as Smith." Hitch made US$368.1 million in its global theatrical run. In 2005, Mendes also starred in the little-seen films The Wendell Baker Story and Guilty Hearts.
<br>
<br>In the romantic comedy Trust the Man (2006), Mendes starred with David Duchovny, Billy Crudup, Julianne Moore, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, playing what The A.V. Club described as a "vapid sexpot". The much criticized Ghost Rider (2007), based on the Marvel Comics character, featured Mendes as the love interest of the titular character (Nicolas Cage). The film fared well commercially, opening atop at the North American box office, with earnings of more than US$45 million; it eventually made over US$228 million worldwide. She starred opposite Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg in the thriller We Own the Night (also 2007), as the girlfriend of an NYPD captain's brother. Critic Peter Travers found the film to be "defiantly, refreshingly unhip" and noted that "sizzle comes naturally" from Mendes. In 2007, she also starred in the films Live! and Cleaner, both of which went unnoticed by audiences, and made an uncredited cameo appearance in the comedy Knocked Up.
<br>
<br>In 2008, Mendes took on the role of a perfume salesgirl in Saks Fifth Avenue in the all-female comedy The Women, opposite Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Debra Messing, and Jada Pinkett Smith. Though a commercial success, The Women was panned by critics, with Mendes earning a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her performance. She also played the femme fatale Sand Saref in 2008's The Spirit, based on the newspaper comic strip of the same name by Will Eisner. It received lackluster reviews from critics, who deemed it melodramatic, unoriginal, and sexist. Her only 2009 film release was the crime drama Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, which reunited her with Nicolas Cage, playing a prostitute, and again, his love interest. While the film found a limited audience in theaters, it garnered acclaim, appearing on many top ten lists of the year.
<br>
<br><strong>Further roles and retirement (2010â€“2014)</strong><br>Mendes reunited with previous collaborators Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg for the action comedy The Other Guys (2010), in which she portrayed the wife of a mild-mannered forensic NYPD accountant (Ferrell). It was a commercial success, grossing US$170.4 million globally. In 2010, she also played the co-worker and the love interest of a committed man in Massy Tadjedin's romantic drama Last Night, alongside Keira Knightley and Sam Worthington. While she was initially reluctant to star, worrying that the character would "lack originality" and was "too seductive", she agreed to play the role after meeting with Tadjedin; she said: "It was great to connect with a female director and talk about this woman and not objectify her as the other woman but give her a real true life and make her honest ... Thank God I did."
<br>
<br>In 2011, Mendes appeared in an uncredited cameo in Fast Five, reprising her role from 2 Fast 2 Furious. In 2012, she starred in the dramedy Girl in Progress, as a single mom raising her fourteen-year-old daughter, and in the art fantasy drama Holy Motors, as Kay M, a role originally written for Kate Moss. While Girl in Progress earned Mendes an ALMA Award nomination for Favorite Movie Actress, she described Holy Motors as "the coolest, most creative thing I've ever done".
<br>
<br>In The Place Beyond the Pines (also 2012), a drama directed by Derek Cianfrance and alongside Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, Mendes portrayed the former lover of a motorcycle stuntman. The film was a moderate commercial success, and Entertainment Weekly, in its review, described her performance as "quietly heartbreaking". She also visited Sierra Leone and was featured in the PBS documentary Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide, which aired in October 2012.
<br>
<br>In 2013, Mendes appeared in the HBO comedy film Clear History as a formerly heavy-set woman, and in 2014, she starred as a cabaret show performer in Ryan Gosling's directorial debut Lost River, which competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the Cannes Film Festival. Thereafter, she retired from the film industry. Speaking of her retirement in 2022, Mendes said:
<br>
<br>"I got tired fighting for the good roles. There just was a point where I thought, â€˜Iâ€™m going to create my own opportunities and become a producer on things and create my own material,â€™ but it just didnâ€™t feel worth it to me. There are more opportunities for Latina actresses now (in 2022), but when I bowed out 10 years ago I wasnâ€™t being offered things that werenâ€™t specifically Latina. It is exciting that things are different now, so who knows what I will do in the future. But right now, Iâ€™m keeping it in the home with my kids."

<br><strong>Other Endeavors</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br><strong style="">Modeling
</strong><br>Mendes appeared in the Pet Shop Boys' music video for "Se a vida Ã© (That's the Way Life Is)" in 1996, Aerosmith's music video for "Hole in My Soul" in 1997, and Will Smith's music video for "Miami" in 1998. She also appeared in the music video for The Strokes' "The End Has No End" in 2004.
<br>
<br>In 2005, Mendes was employed by Revlon as an international spokesperson, and participated in their campaign to raise funds for breast cancer research. In December 2007, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) used a nude photo of Mendes for their anti-fur campaign. Mendes was a spokesmodel for the 2008 Campari calendar. She also appeared nude in a 2008 print advertisement for Calvin Klein's Secret Obsession perfume, an ad that United States network executives found too risquÃ© for broadcasting.
<br>
<br>Mendes has been a spokesperson for Calvin Klein, Magnum, and the chocolate milk brand Cocio. She also promoted Thierry Mugler's Angel fragrance, Reebok shoes, and Pantene shampoo. In 2011, Mendes appeared in a Peek &amp; Cloppenburg clothing catalog.
<br>
<br><strong>Fashion designing
</strong><br>Mendes has a line of bed linens and dinnerware that is sold at Macy's. In February 2013, she partnered with New York &amp; Co. to launch her own fashion line, Eva by Eva Mendes. She is also the creative director of the makeup brand CIRCA Beauty, which launched exclusively at Walgreens in 2015.
<br>
<br><strong>Singing
</strong><br>In 2010, Mendes sang "Pimps Don't Cry", a song featured in The Other Guys, and also performed a duet with CeeLo Green with the same song. In 2011, she recorded a version of "The Windmills of Your Mind". She also featured in the single "Miami" sung by Will Smith which was released in 1998.
<br>
<br><strong>Public image<br></strong>Many media outlets have cited her as one of the world's most beautiful Latin women, and she has been often considered a sex symbol. She once embraced that status, saying it was "partially self-created ... I think at times I play up my sexiness. And there's times where I don't", though she does not let it interfere with her film work: "I like it when it doesn't limit my career. It's a part of my life, but on a secondary plane". Nevertheless, her professional trajectory throughout the 2000s tended to gravitate towards parts that relied heavily on her looks. She has not appeared in a film since 2014.
<br>
<br>Mendes ranked 54th, 12th, 7th, 7th, and 11th in Maxim magazine's Hot 100 issue in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2010 respectively, and appeared several times on the cover. She also ranked 80th, 23rd and 44th in FHM magazine's "100 Sexiest Women in the World" supplement in 2004, 2005, 2006. She was voted number four in the 2008 edition, and number one in the 2009 edition, of AskMen.com's Top 99 Most Desirable Women. People also named her one of 2011's Most Beautiful at Every Age.
<br>
<br><strong>Personal life
<br></strong>Mendes began dating music producer George Augusto in 2002. They broke up in 2011.
<br>
<br>In 2008, she entered the Cirque Lodge Rehabilitation Centre in Utah to address a dependency problem related to drugs and alcohol.
<br>
<br>In September 2011, she began dating Ryan Gosling, shortly after they filmed The Place Beyond the Pines together. They have two daughters, born in 2014 and 2016.
<br>
<br>Mendes is a pescatarian for ethical and health reasons. She also practices Transcendental Meditation.<br><br><br></p>
