<br>He had the idea to develop the music from his album Idris Elba Presents Mi Mandela into a show, which eventually resulted in a play called Tree that premiered at the Manchester International Festival in 2019. However, authorship of the piece was disputed. On 2 July 2019, The Guardian published a story describing how writers Tori Allen-Martin and Sarah Henley said they had been removed from the production under what they described as questionable circumstances. The two writers had worked on the project for four years, following an approach from Elba asking them to develop his idea for a musical based on the album, on which Allen-Martin had also collaborated. Kwame Kwei-Armah joined the project in May 2018, and rewrote part of their material. At the time of its premiere, Tree was billed as "created by Idris Elba and Kwame Kwei-Armah". Allen-Martin and Henley described their creative input as having included research and script-writing, as well as coming up with the play's title, and that after being removed, they were threatened with legal action if they went public with the story. Elba and Kwei-Armah both published rebuttals of the writers' account of what happened on Twitter.

In an April 2021 interview with Den of Geek, he said the series is "mainly the brainchild" of his wife, whom he described as a "super geek when it comes to anime".
<br>

<br><strong>Kickboxing
</strong><br>Discovery Channel produced a documentary, Idris Elba: Fighter, chronicling Elba's twelve-month kickboxing and mixed martial arts training under Muay Thai coach Kieran Keddle, culminating in Elba's first professional kickboxing fight—and win—against Lionel Graves, a younger, more experienced Dutch opponent, at London's York Hall.<br><br><strong>Personal life
<br></strong>Elba has been married three times: first to Hanne "Kim" Nørgaard (from 1999 to 2003) and then to Sonya Nicole Hamlin (for four months in 2006). He has a daughter with Nørgaard and a son with former girlfriend Naiyana Garth. Elba began a relationship with Canadian model Sabrina Dhowre in early 2017. They became engaged on 10 February 2018, during a screening of his film Yardie at an East London cinema. They were married on 26 April 2019 in Marrakesh.
<br>
<br>Elba has stated he is spiritual but not religious. He is a supporter of Arsenal. In 2015, as part of his Discovery Channel miniseries Idris Elba: No Limits, he broke the land speed record for the Pendine Sands "Flying Mile" course.
<br>
<br>The Prince's Trust, a UK youth charity founded by Prince Charles in 1976, which Elba credits with helping begin his career, appointed him as their anti-crime ambassador in April 2009. He served on the Board of Governors of the British Film Institute between 2018 to 2022.
<br>
<br>He voiced support for a vote to remain in the European Union for the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. He is a campaigner against knife crime.
<br>
<br><strong>Awards and honours
</strong><br>In 2013, Elba was named Essence's annual Sexiest Man of the Year and, in 2018, he was named People's Sexiest Man Alive. In October 2014, he was presented with a MOBO Inspiration Award.
<br>
<br>Elba was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to drama. In 2017, he won the male title for the "Rear of the Year" award in Britain.
<br>
<br>In September 2018, he was one of 50 people named for "making London awesome" and helping to shape London's cultural landscape, as part of Time Out's 50th anniversary. In the 2020 and 2021 editions of the Powerlist, he was listed in the top 100 most influential people in the UK of African/Afro-Caribbean descent.<br><strong><br></strong><br><strong><br></strong></p>
