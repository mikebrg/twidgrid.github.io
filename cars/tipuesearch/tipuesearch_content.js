{"title": "	Zenvo	", "text": "	Zenvo Automotive A/S is a Danish sports car manufacturer located in Præstø on the Danish Island of Zealand. Co-founded in 2007 by Jesper Jensen and Troels Vollertsen, the company ran under the name Nordic Sports Car A/S until 2009 when the company was rebranded to Zenvo Automotive to tie in the reveal of the ST1. In June 2018 the company was sold to Czech investors, based in Prague. The name 'Zenvo' is derived from a combination of the last three and first two letters in Vollertsen's last name.
