The Peugeot 206 is a highly successful supermini car (B-segment) produced from 1998 to 2012, known for its distinctive styling, fun driving experience, and a wide range of available body styles and engines. It holds the record as the best-selling Peugeot model of all time. <p>Overview<p>Launched as a belated replacement for the iconic Peugeot 205, the 206 quickly gained popularity across Europe. Its design, led by Murat Günak and Gérard Welter, was a significant departure from its predecessor, featuring a curvier, more modern look. The car was praised for its agility in urban driving and for the character of its chassis, which could be engaging, especially in the performance-oriented models like the 206 GTi and 206 RC. <p>Body Styles and Variants<p>The 206 was offered in numerous configurations to cater to different market needs: <p>3-door and 5-door Hatchback: The standard, and most common, body style.<p>206 CC: A popular coupé convertible featuring a powered, fold-away metal roof, a pioneering feature in its class at the time.<p>206 SW: A practical station wagon (estate) version, offering increased cargo space with a split-opening tailgate.<p>206 Sedan: A 4-door notchback version primarily aimed at emerging markets outside of Europe. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>The Peugeot 206's reliability record can be mixed, though many engines are considered robust if maintained correctly. Its estimated lifespan is around 141,000 miles, according to VehicleScore. <p>Electrical Faults: The multiplex wiring system, introduced in later models, can be a source of various gremlins, including issues with central locking, indicators, and window regulators.<p>Rear Suspension: The rear suspension system, featuring a trailing arm with torsion bars, requires regular maintenance of the bearings and seals; failure to do so can lead to costly axle replacement.
Engine Issues: The 1.6L petrol engine can be prone to head gasket problems if it overheats. The 1.4L petrol and the 2.0L HDi diesel engines are generally regarded as the most reliable options.<p>Interior Quality: Some reviewers noted the interior quality as poor, with concerns over seats and ventilation systems. <p>Prospective buyers of used models should look for a comprehensive service history and be mindful of these common issues.
