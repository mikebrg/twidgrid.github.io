The Peugeot 408 is a C-segment vehicle that exists in two distinct forms: a traditional saloon (sedan) sold in China, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, and a newer, stylish fastback crossover model introduced in 2022 for markets like Europe and China (where it is known as the 408 X). <p>Fastback Crossover (Europe, China)<p>The current global 408 is a radical, elevated fastback that combines elements of a saloon, SUV, and coupe, known for its bold design and aerodynamic efficiency. <p>Design: Features a dynamic silhouette with a sloping roofline, increased ground clearance, and an aggressive front fascia with signature "fang-like" LED daytime running lights. Aerodynamic "cat ears" above the tailgate help manage airflow.<p>Interior: Equipped with the latest generation PEUGEOT i-Cockpit, featuring a compact steering wheel and a 10-inch digital instrument panel and a 10-inch HD central touchscreen. It includes configurable i-Toggles, which are touch-sensitive shortcut buttons for frequently used functions.<p>Boot Space: Offers generous boot capacity, with 536 litres in the petrol version and 471 litres in the plug-in hybrid model. <p>Powertrain Options<p>The fastback 408 is available with petrol, mild-hybrid, and plug-in hybrid options. <p>Petrol: A 1.2L PureTech 130 hp turbo engine with an 8-speed automatic transmission.<p>Mild-Hybrid: A new 1.2L Hybrid 136 hp with a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.<p>Plug-in Hybrids: Two options combining a 1.6L petrol engine with an electric motor:<p>Hybrid 180 e-EAT8 (180 hp total output).<p>Hybrid 225 e-EAT8 (225 hp total output). These models offer a pure electric driving range of approximately 34 miles (55 km). <p>Saloon/Sedan (China, Latin America, etc.)<p>A separate, more traditional four-door saloon model of the Peugeot 408 is marketed in China and other specific international markets. This version is built on the EMP2 platform and is available with different petrol engine options, such as the 1.6L THP and 1.8L engines. <p>The Peugeot 408 is not available in North America.
