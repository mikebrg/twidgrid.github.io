The Renault Triber is a mini MPV with three-row seating, primarily produced for the Indian market by the French car manufacturer Renault through its Indian subsidiary Renault India. It was introduced in India on 19 June 2019 and went on sale in August 2019.<p>Overview
Development<p>Developed under the body code "RBC", the Triber is built on top of the CMF-A platform like the Kwid. Despite that, the car is built with over 90% dedicated parts not shared with other Renault and Nissan vehicles since it is a larger and wider car in the CMF-A family.<p>Laurens van den Acker, Corporate Design of Groupe Renault said the interior of the car is a "miracle" and refers to it as "a bit of a Leonardo da Vinci" as it offers three-row seating in a sub-four metre length. This was achieved by making the bonnet and engine bay as short as possible, making it not possible to fit a diesel engine or any larger petrol engine to the car. The car's width is spanning at 1,739 mm (68.5 in) to maximize cabin space, especially in the second row where three people had to fit comfortably. The stretched wheelbase and the reduced overhang also contributed to the spacious cabin space which Van den Acker claimed is around 3 metres long. The second row seats comes with a reclining and split folding function. There is a dedicated AC vent for the third row of seats, armrests and charging sockets. The third row can be removed altogether to liberate up to 625 L (38,140 cu in) of boot space.<p>One of the difficult parts of the development of the Triber is maximizing the headroom for the third-row passengers, as the space is usually occupied by the rear hatch door hinge mechanism. The rear part of the roof is raised, allowing more headroom and a roof-mounted air conditioner blowers. The roof bump is masked by the roof rail, making it less visible.<p>The car is also designed with a faux-crossover look, which Van den Acker said "gives the car a much tougher stand, and brings it in an SUV sphere". It would also make the car appeal to consumers in India who prefers a high driving position and high ground clearance.
