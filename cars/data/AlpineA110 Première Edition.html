Pre-orders for the special 'First Edition' opened on 7 December 2016, via the Alpine app, and it was available in 13 countries in 1955 units, a reference to the brand's founding year. Customers who wanted to buy this special series had to pay a deposit of 2000 euros, choose the number and color of the body they wanted. Alpine says all units were booked in one weekend, but opened classic orders shortly after. The entire production was pre-booked in three days. In the contract, the brand recommends a selling price between 55,000 and 60,000 euros (for the 'Première Edition') and announced that the first deliveries took place at the end of 2017. In March 2017, Alpine revealed its price, being 58,500 euros.
