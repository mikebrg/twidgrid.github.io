The D6-75 appeared for 1939, effectively replacing the D6-70 which had by now been withdrawn. Its 2798 cc 6-cylinder engine was considered particularly refined. Power output was quoted at 95 hp (71 kW). In 1940 production was ended by the rapid invasion of northern France, following the declaration of war at the end of the previous summer.
