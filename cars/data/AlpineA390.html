The Alpine A390 is a battery-electric compact crossover SUV by French automobile manufacturer Alpine. First shown in concept form as the Alpine A390_β at the 2024 Paris Motor Show, the production model was unveiled on 27 May 2025. It is the second of seven 'Dream Garage' fully-electric models which Alpine intends to release by 2030.<p>The Alpine A390 (internal code DZ110) is set to be produced domestically in the brand's historic Manufacture Alpine Dieppe Jean Rédélé.<p>The A390 is based on the modular AmpR Medium technical platform of the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance, also used by the Renault Scenic E-Tech and its cousin Nissan Ariya, from which it also takes the most powerful motor. The car features 'vehicle-to-grid' (V2G) bidirectional charging.<p>Two variants of the A390 have been announced: the GT, with 295kW (400hp) of power, a top speed of 200km/hour (124mph), and acceleration of 4.8 second 0-100km/hour (0-60mph); and the GTS, with 346kW (470hp), a top speed of 220km/hour (137mph), and acceleration of 3.9 seconds 0-100km.<p>A patented, 'overtake' function, activated by a red button on the steering wheel, provides ten seconds of additional boost with a thirty-second cooldown period, or five seconds of boost with a fifteen-second cooldown period. The button also controls an optimized drag-strip launch function.<p>The interior is finished in blue leather, features two 12-inch screens, and both manual and on-screen controls.<p>On 11 October 2024, as a prelude to the 2024 Paris Motor Show, Alpine presented the Alpine A390_β concept car, a precursor to the production Alpine A390, the brand's first SUV. The concept featured rear doors that open in reverse and a glass roof.
