The Aixam Coupé Premium, a compact and stylish quadricycle, was introduced in 2014 as part of Aixam's Sensation range. Designed to be driven without a full driving license in many European countries, it catered to a growing market seeking practical yet fashionable urban mobility solutions. The model featured a 400cc engine delivering 5.4 horsepower, enabling a top speed of 45 km/h, which complies with the L6e category regulations for light quadricycles. Its sleek design and efficient performance made it a popular choice among young drivers and those seeking an economical alternative to traditional cars.<p>
Production of the Coupé Premium continued until 2020, after which it was discontinued. During its production run, the model underwent various updates and refinements to enhance safety, comfort, and design. Aixam's commitment to innovation was evident as they continued to develop and promote their industrial know-how, ensuring that their vehicles met the evolving demands of the market. While the Coupé Premium is no longer in production, it remains a notable example of Aixam's contribution to the microcar segment, offering a blend of style, practicality, and accessibility for urban drivers.
