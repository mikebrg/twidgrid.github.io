The Aixam Coupé GTI was produced from 2014 to 2020.
<p>The Aixam Coupé GTI, a compact and sporty microcar, entered production in 2014. It was designed to cater to young drivers, particularly those who could drive with an AM licence in Europe. The model featured a 400cc engine, delivering 5.4 horsepower, and weighed approximately 350 kg. Its design included sporty elements such as a glossy black honeycomb grille, LED indicator lights on wing mirrors, scrolling front and rear indicators, and 16" black diamond-finish alloy wheel rims .

In 2016, Aixam introduced the e-Coupé GTI, an electric version of the Coupé GTI. This model maintained the sporty design elements of its predecessor but offered an eco-friendly alternative with electric propulsion. The e-Coupé GTI was available in various metallic colors, including silver, titanium, blue, black, red, pearl white, and yellow.<p>
Production of the Aixam Coupé GTI continued until 2020, after which it was succeeded by newer models in Aixam's lineup. Despite its discontinuation, the Coupé GTI remains a notable example of Aixam's commitment to providing stylish and accessible vehicles for young drivers in Europe.
