Microcar Virgo 3 Pratic
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The Microcar Virgo 3 Pratic was a commercial or utility variant of the third-generation Virgo microcar, produced in the early 2000s. The "Pratic" designation indicated its purpose as a practical, cargo-carrying vehicle, featuring an extended rear section designed for carrying goods rather than passengers. <p>Key features<p>Body style: Unlike the standard Virgo's hatchback body, the Pratic had an extended van-like body with two rear doors, offering a greater load capacity for deliveries or other commercial use.<p>Engine: It was equipped with the typical microcar diesel engine of its era, often a small Lombardini unit with a displacement of around 505 ccm. This engine was paired with an automatic Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT).<p>Production run: The Virgo 3 Pratic was available during the early 2000s, as part of the Virgo 3 lineup produced from around 2002 to 2005.<p>Target market: The Pratic was aimed at businesses and individuals who needed a compact vehicle for light commercial transport in urban areas, particularly within the European license-exempt quadricycle market. <p>Legacy<p>The Virgo 3 Pratic demonstrated Microcar's approach to offering both passenger and commercial vehicles based on the same platform. Following the acquisition of Microcar by Ligier in 2008, the cargo-carrying niche was later filled by models like the Ligier X-Pro.
