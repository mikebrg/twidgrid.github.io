Bugatti Tourbillon
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The Bugatti Tourbillon is an upcoming mid-engine hybrid sports car manufactured by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti. The Tourbillon succeeds the Chiron and is limited to 250 units. It was unveiled in an online live stream on 20 June 2024. It is priced at €3.8 million (US$4.1 million).<p>The car is named after the tourbillon, a mechanism used in certain high end mechanical watches to increase their accuracy.<p>Bugatti states that the Tourbillon is a completely new design, and does not share any components with the outgoing Chiron. However, in keeping with the Bugatti brand lineage, it does share many of its key design cues, including the horseshoe grille, central spine, C-shaped side body lines, and two-tone body colour. One of the stated inspirations for the Tourbillon was mechanical watches, with the interior featuring a number of watch inspired details. Another design theme of the Tourbillon is "skeletonized" mechanical design, where the mechanisms of components are made visible as a part of the design.<p>The interior of the Tourbillon features a fully analog instrument cluster operated by mechanical gears and designed to look like a watch movement, with the speedometer and tachometer needles arranged to resemble an hour and minute hand. It also features a steering wheel with a fixed central hub where only the outer rim rotates, allowing the instrument cluster to remain visible at all times. Unlike past Bugatti models, the Tourbillon features a center infotainment screen, which retracts into the dashboard when not in use. Bugatti says that, like in past models, their goal was to make sure that the car remains "timeless", even when the screen technology becomes outdated. The center panel of the Tourbillon is made from machined aluminum and machined crystal glass, while the watch-inspired instrument cluster is made from titanium by Swiss watchmaker Concepto.
