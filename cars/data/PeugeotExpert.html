The Peugeot Expert is a versatile and popular mid-size commercial van produced since 1996, available today in both efficient diesel and 100% electric (e-Expert) variants, known for its practicality and flexible loading options. <p>Features and Design<p>The current generation Expert, which was voted Commercial Vehicle of the Year 2021, offers a blend of compact external dimensions (a height under 1.9m ensures access to most car parks) and a large load area. <p>Modularity: A key feature is the Moduwork® bench seat option, which allows the side passenger seat to fold up, creating a flat floor and an opening in the bulkhead to significantly increase the load length (up to 4m) for carrying long items.<p>Capacity: It is available in different lengths (Standard and Long) with a payload capacity of up to 1,000 kg (1 tonne) for diesel models and up to 1,200 kg for e-Expert models. Load volumes go up to 6.1 m³.<p>Modern Amenities: Newer models feature the PEUGEOT i-Cockpit, advanced driver assistance systems, and connectivity options like Apple CarPlay. <p>Powertrain Options<p>The Expert is available with a range of engines to suit different business needs. <p>Diesel: The diesel range primarily consists of BlueHDi engines, including 1.5-litre and 2.0-litre variants, known for their efficiency and smooth power delivery.<p>Electric (e-Expert): The e-Expert uses a 100 kW (136 hp) electric motor with a choice of 50 kWh or 75 kWh battery packs.<p>Range: The 75 kWh battery offers a WLTP range of up to 330-350 km (~211 miles).<p>Charging: It supports 7.4 kW and optional 11 kW AC charging, as well as 100 kW DC rapid charging, which can achieve an 80% charge in about 30-45 minutes. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>The Expert has a generally robust reputation, but owners should be aware of a few recurring issues: <p>Timing Belt/Chain Issues: Particularly on the 1.6 HDi and some 1.5 BlueHDi engines, the timing components can be a weak point, potentially leading to significant engine damage if not serviced promptly.<p>DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) Problems: As with many modern diesels, frequent short trips can cause the DPF to clog, requiring proper regeneration cycles to avoid performance issues.<p>Suspension Wear: The front anti-roll bar bushes and other suspension components can wear out prematurely, especially when the van is consistently heavily loaded.<p>Electrical Issues: Some electrical gremlins have been reported across generations, including problems with the power steering and dashboard displays, which can sometimes be linked to a faulty battery.
