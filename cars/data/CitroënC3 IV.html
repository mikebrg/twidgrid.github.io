The Citroën C3 is a supermini car (B-segment) produced by Citroën since April 2002. It replaced the Citroën Saxo in the model line up, and is currently in its fourth generation. Initial models of the Citroën C3 were built using the same platform as the Peugeot 206. The third generation model was released in January 2017, and has been developed alongside the Peugeot 208 since 2019.<p>The C3 is produced in a five-door hatchback body style, with the first generation also being produced in a two-door convertible version, called the C3 Pluriel. A three-door hatchback, with a similar design as the second generation, was available as the Citroën DS3 and marketed as a premium model.<p>A mini MPV derivative of the C3 was announced in July 2008, called the C3 Picasso. In South America, a mini SUV version called the C3 Aircross, was produced and marketed only locally.<p>In September 2021, a new, low-cost model was introduced for the Indian and South American markets. During its introduction, Citroën CEO Vincent Cobée mentioned that the "C3" is the trade name for all Citroën B-segment hatchbacks around the world. This model was extensively modified and upgraded for the European market as the fourth-generation C3, which was introduced in October 2023. The third and fourth-generation C3 are available with a battery electric variant.
