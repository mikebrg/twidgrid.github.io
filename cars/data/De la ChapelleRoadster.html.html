Overview & Origins<p>De La Chapelle (DLC / DLC Technologies) is a small French boutique carmaker founded by Xavier de La Chapelle, reviving a family legacy in automobile building. <p>
The brand is better known for its neo-classic “replica” style cars (inspired by Bugatti Type 55, etc.), but in the mid-1990s it attempted a more “modern” small sports car: the DLC Roadster. <p>The Roadster was first unveiled (in concept / prototype form) at the 1996 Paris Motor Show. <p>On DLC’s official “our history” timeline, the Roadster’s launch is marked in 1996. <p>WheelsAge (a car photographic / cataloguing site) lists the DLC Roadster as existing from 1998 to (presumably) present / prototype stage. <p>
So: it seems the Roadster was conceived in 1996, but production / limited delivery likely began a couple of years later, around 1998.<p>Design & Technical Highlights<p>Layout & Engineering<p>The DLC Roadster is a mid-engine, two-seater convertible / open-top design. 
<p>Its chassis was developed / refined (in particular the right-hand drive prototype) by engineer Philippe Beloou, who reworked the structure into a tub + spaceframe form with independent suspension (double wishbones front; 5-link rear with coil-overs) to improve dynamics. <p>The styling is by Bertrand Barré / Barré Design, noted for its attractive “neo-retro yet muscular” lines. <p>The bodywork molds and chassis jigs were to be manufactured in France and shipped (in some proposals) for assembly elsewhere (e.g. India) to reduce labor cost. <p>Powertrain & Performance<p>The prototype / intended version used a Peugeot 2.0 L (I4) engine, producing about 167 bhp. <p>In some references, alternate configurations are mentioned: e.g. a 3.0 L (6-cylinder) version is sometimes cited in user forums about the Roadster. <p>With the 2.0 L engine and a kerb weight of ~900 kg (as per estimates in press coverage), the Roadster was projected to reach a top speed around 220 km/h. <p>In more enthusiastic (but less formal) sources, it’s claimed that a 0–60 mph (≈0-96 km/h) time is ~6 seconds, and maxing ~140 mph (~225 km/h). <p>Production & Volumes<p>Because DLC is a small-volume boutique builder, the Roadster was never intended for mass production. <p>One story: DLC signed an agreement in January 1997 with an Indian company (DLC-Sagitta, founded by Shrikant Shah & Nikesh Thakkar) to build the Roadster in India, shipping molds and jigs there, and exhibiting a version in India. Unfortunately, the project ran into financial difficulties: the main investor’s death, internal disputes, and lack of capital caused the factory plan to collapse. Some proposals or attempts were made to produce a few units (even via a British concern, Reliant), but whether more than a handful were ever built is unclear. Official DLC history (on their site) mentions “4 exemplars” for the 1996 Roadster. In various accounts, the Roadster is treated more like a low-volume or prototype series rather than a fully commercial production run.
