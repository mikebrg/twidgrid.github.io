On 8 June 2021, Bugatti introduced the standard version of the 300+ world record car. Unlike the 300+, it does not come with interior stiffening and has more leather in the interior like a typical Bugatti Chiron. More visual differences include special redesigned wheels and a paint finish instead of the bare carbon fibre seen in the 300+. The Chiron Super Sport had the same power output as the 300+ but was limited to 440 km/h (273 mph). It also has the capability to accelerate from 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 5.8 seconds and from 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 12.1 seconds. Unlike the 300+, the limiter cannot be disabled by Bugatti in the Super Sport for prepared runs. Customer delivery started in early 2022 at a net unit price of €3.2 million each. The first car was delivered in April 2022. About 70–80 were built, including the L'Ultime, which is the very last of the Chiron series. It is the last car to use the Bugatti W16 engine, and likely the last car to use an engine of this layout in general.
