Reviewers note that while the Rifter prioritizes comfort and practicality over driving thrills, it handles well for a large family SUV. The fully electric version offers the quietest and smoothest power delivery, while the mild-hybrid's three-cylinder engine can be a bit noisy under heavy acceleration. The ride, however, can be a little firm and unsettled over rough surfaces.
