The Peugeot 504 is a durable and iconic mid-size car manufactured by Peugeot from 1968 to 1983 in Europe, with production in other parts of the world continuing until 2006. It was highly praised for its comfort, ruggedness, and suitability for rough terrains, earning the 1969 European Car of the Year award. <p>Overview and Reputation<p>The 504 was designed in collaboration with Pininfarina, resulting in a distinctive and modern design with unique, raked headlights and a sloping trunk lid. It gained a reputation for being an "immortal" car, particularly in Africa and Latin America, where its robust body, long suspension travel, and high ground clearance made it an effective workhorse and even a successful rally car. In Europe, it was known as a comfortable, refined, and reliable saloon (sedan), available with innovative features for its time such as fuel injection and a brake pad wear warning indicator. <p>Noted Features and User Experience<p>Ride Quality The fully independent suspension system (on most models) provided a superb, comfortable ride, often compared favorably to the Citroën DS.<p>Durability The car's robust construction and reliable mechanics, especially the diesel engines, meant many models are still in use as "bush taxis" and work vehicles in various parts of the world, highlighting its longevity.<p>Interior Comfort The seats were widely praised as some of the most comfortable available at the time.<p>Rally History A V6 coupé version of the Peugeot 504 was successfully campaigned in the World Rally Championship, including winning the 1978 Safari Rally and Bandama Rally, which cemented its rugged image.<p>Collectibility Today, the rarer coupé and cabriolet versions, with their Pininfarina styling, are highly sought after by collectors.
