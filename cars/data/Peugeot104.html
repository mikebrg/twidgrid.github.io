The Peugeot 104 is a classic supermini car produced from 1972 to 1988. It was a pioneering model for Peugeot, known for being one of the first modern "supermini" hatchbacks and for introducing the compact, space-efficient "transverse engine with gearbox in the sump" layout that would become standard for the industry. <p>Overview and Design<p>The 104 was designed to be practical, economical, and modern. It was launched first as a four-door saloon (a very short three-box design) before quickly gaining a popular three-door hatchback variant. The five-door hatchback was introduced later. The design was the work of Pininfarina, contributing to its neat and timeless appearance. <p>Engine Layout: Its most innovative feature was the all-aluminium overhead camshaft "Suitcase Engine" (so named because all its components, including the gearbox and differential, were contained within one single casing), a design later used in the iconic Peugeot 205 and various Citroën models.<p>Safety: It was one of the first cars in its class to incorporate crumple zones and an integrated safety cell, prioritizing passenger protection. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>As a car out of production for many years, the primary challenges for owning a 104 today are related to age and rust. When new, it was considered a reliable and robust small car. <p>Rust: Corrosion is the biggest issue. The sills, wheel arches, front wings, and boot floor are common areas where rust takes hold.<p>Engine Maintenance: The "Suitcase Engine" is generally robust, but timing chains can stretch over time, requiring attention. It is also important to maintain the cooling system meticulously, as overheating can cause head gasket issues.<p>Suspension: The simple suspension system can wear out, with bushes and dampers needing replacement to maintain its handling characteristics.<p>Parts Availability: Sourcing specific body panels and some interior components can be challenging due to the age of the vehicle.<p>The Peugeot 104 is a significant piece of automotive history, paving the way for the supermini class that would later be dominated by its successor, the Peugeot 205.
