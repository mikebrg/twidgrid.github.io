The Zenvo TS1 GT is a limited production sports car manufactured by Danish automobile manufacturer Zenvo Automotive. It was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. Though the TS1 GT shares a similar chassis and body with its predecessor, the ST1, its new powertrain and upgraded interior earn it a new model designation along with the 'grand tourer' qualification. The production of the car is planned to be limited at 5 units per year, an increase from the limited 15-car total production run of its predecessor.<p>Specifications <p>Engine<p>The Zenvo TS1 GT is powered by a 5.8-litre Twin-supercharged V8 engine which is based on a Chevrolet GM architecture and is further modified and developed in-house, rated at 823 kW (1,119 PS; 1,104 hp) at 7,100 rpm and 1,139 N⋅m (840 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,500 rpm. The engine has mid-rear mounted position.<p>Transmission and suspension<p>The TS1 GT is equipped with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic with helical-cut dog gears. The transmission is paired with a Torsen limited-slip differential and the clutch consists of two 240 mm (9.4 in) discs. The car uses double wishbone suspension coupled with adjustable shocks and composite anti-roll bars on the front and rear axles. A hydraulic lifting mechanism is able to raise the front axle by 50 mm for extra ground clearance.<p>Wheels<p>The TS1 GT is equipped with forged aluminum wheels with diameters of 483 millimetres (19 in) at the front and 508 millimetres (20 in) at the rear. The car uses Michelin Pilot Sport 4S or Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires with codes of 265/35 ZR 19 at the front and 345/30 ZR 20 at the rear. The brakes are ventilated carbon ceramic discs, with a diameter of 395 mm (15.6 in) at the front and 380 mm (15 in) at the rear, each equipped with six-piston aluminum calipers.<p>Interior features<p>The interior of the Zenvo TS1 GT features a dashboard and central console finished in carbon-fiber and Alcantara, along with carbon-fiber bucket seats for the driver and passenger. The infotainment system includes a dashboard display, central display, and an Alpine audio system with Bluetooth connectivity.<p>Performance<p>The manufacturer claims an electronically limited top speed of 375 km/h (233 mph) for the TS1 GT. The car has a claimed 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 3.0 seconds. These performance figures are very similar to those of its predecessor.
