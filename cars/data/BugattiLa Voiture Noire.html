Bugatti La Voiture Noire
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The La Voiture Noire is a one-off special introduced at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. Based on the Chiron, the design of the car harkens back to the Type 57 SC Atlantic and is a celebration of the company's distinctive design history. The car has a hand-built body made from carbon fibre designed by Bugatti designer Etienne Salomé which has an elongated nose (similar to that on the Divo) and an elongated back section. Other notable features include unique wing mirrors, LED taillight strip, and wheels. Unlike the original, the car has a mid-engine layout.<p>A trim piece running from the front of the car to the rear spoiler recalls the dorsal fin present on the Type 57 SC. The car features a floating windscreen and has masked A-pillars. The La Voiture Noire shares many design similarities with the Bugatti Rembrandt, a cancelled front-engine grand tourer powered by the Chiron's W16 engine.<p>The La Voiture Noire is powered by the same 8.0-litre quad-turbocharged W16 engine from the Chiron having the same power output figures but the 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox and the all-wheel-drive system are heavily revised in order to allow for a more relaxed driving experience. Softer dampers and a revised chassis contribute to the factor. The car features six exhaust pipes recalling the innovative design of the past.<p>Performance figures remain unknown but the company states that the car is likely to have lower top speed and acceleration times as compared to the Chiron due to its Grand Touring nature. The car sold for £9.5 million, which makes it one of the most expensive cars built to date.<p>A statement made later by the company confirmed that the car on display was a concept car and that the final product would take two and a half years more to complete. The show car had electric motors instead of an engine for easy maneuverability. Differing from the show car, the real La Voiture Noire has a Cognac (Brown) Leather Interior and a fully-functioning drivetrain with its W16 engine sourced from the Chiron.<p>According to reports from tabloid newspapers, La Voiture Noire was registered in Zurich, Switzerland in December 2021. La Voiture Noire is owned by a member of the family of the late Ferdinand Piëch, the man for whom the car was initially commissioned (though he died before receiving it).<p>La Voiture Noire has been subject to significant misinformation surrounding its ownership. A number of newspapers, tabloids, and online blogs created and spread false claims that Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo was the owner of the vehicle. This rumour, which is believed to have originated with a report from Spanish sports newspaper Marca was denied by a spokesperson for Ronaldo.
