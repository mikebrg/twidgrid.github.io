By October 1937 Delage were also listing at the Paris motor show a D8-120 model, which was essentially a D8-100 with the cylinder bore/diameter increased by 4 mm. Listed power was now 120 hp (88 kW) at 4,500 rpm. A long-wheelbase D8-120 was featured prominently in An American in Paris. (Image here.)<p>Unusual is the Aerosport Coupé, which featured a pillarless hardtop body ten years before General Motors introduced hardtops for their Buick and Cadillac lines.<p>In 1939 the larger engine from the D8-120 also found its way into the D8-100. However, with the declaration of war in 1939 and the invasion of northern France, in 1940, passenger car production came to an end, as the Delahaye plant was taken over by the German military occupation. Although the six-cylinder Delages would return in 1946, the eight-cylinder D8 series did not.
