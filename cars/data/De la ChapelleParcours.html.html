The De La Chapelle Parcours was a luxury super-monospace / high-end MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) concept by the French boutique automaker De La Chapelle (also called DLC), under Xavier de La Chapelle. It attempted to combine comfort, luxury, space (6-8 seats), and performance — not something you usually see in that vehicle category.<p>It has a distinctly ambitious pedigree: designed by Bertrand Barré, with attention to aerodynamics (Cx ~ 0.28), using advanced chassis technology for its day (multi-tubular frame, aluminium honeycomb floor panels) and mixed high-performance powerplants.<p>Years of Manufacture / Production & Prototypes<p>The project was launched around 1988, following a commission by a (foreign) client.<p>The actual production of three units (all prototypes) took place between 1990 and 1991 (some sources suggest up to 1992 for display at Geneva).<p>Only one of the three was fully developed and homologated for road use. The others were pre-series / development prototypes.
