The Microcar Lyra was a two-seat, three-door hatchback produced by the French company Microcar. It was one of the brand's earlier popular models, aimed at the "sans permis" (license-exempt) market. <p>Here are the details on the Microcar Lyra:<p>Production run: The Lyra was manufactured during the 1990s and early 2000s. The "Odyssey" version was produced around 1995, while the "first generation" ran from approximately 1997 to 2002.<p>Engine and performance: Like many microcars, the Lyra was equipped with a small, single-cylinder diesel engine. The 1995 Lyra Odyssey, for example, had a 273 ccm diesel engine with a power output of 5 hp and a top speed of 45 km/h (about 28 mph).<p>Key features:<p>Compact design: The Lyra had a small footprint, measuring just over 2.5 meters in length, making it ideal for navigating crowded city streets.<p>Body: It featured a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout and came with a CVT gearbox.<p>Market: The Lyra helped Microcar establish a foothold in the microcar market, particularly in France, where it was popular among young drivers and those without a traditional driver's license.<p>Legacy: The Lyra was part of a lineup that helped Microcar grow into a major microcar manufacturer. It was succeeded by newer Microcar models, such as the Virgo, before Microcar was acquired by Ligier in 2008.
