The Peugeot 604 is an executive saloon car produced from 1975 to 1985, which served as the brand's flagship model during that decade. It was praised for its elegant design (styled by Pininfarina), luxurious comfort, and for being one of the first cars to use the innovative V6 "PRV" engine shared with Renault and Volvo. <p>Overview and Design<p>The 604 was built on a stretched version of the Peugeot 504 platform and featured a large, comfortable cabin designed for executive transport. While its handling and ride quality were widely praised, it struggled to compete effectively with more established premium rivals like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series. The car also had safety innovations for its time, such as impact-absorbing zones. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>As a classic vehicle, the 604's condition depends heavily on past maintenance. When new, it was considered a comfortable but somewhat complex vehicle. <p>Rust: Corrosion is the primary enemy of surviving 604s. Common areas include the wheel arches, sills, and around the front headlights.
PRV V6 Engine Issues:<p>Timing Chain: Early versions of the PRV V6 (shared with other brands) had timing chain tensioner issues that could cause serious engine damage if not addressed.<p>Oil Leaks: The engine can be prone to oil leaks from various seals and gaskets.<p>Cooling System: Overheating due to cooling system issues is a risk, requiring diligent maintenance of the radiator and hoses.<p>Electrical Faults: Older electrical systems can be a source of minor gremlins, with dashboard gauges and lighting being common problem areas. <p>The Peugeot 604 is now a rare classic, cherished by enthusiasts for its unique blend of French luxury and driving comfort.
