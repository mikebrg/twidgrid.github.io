Delage D6-70
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
For 1937 Delage presented the D6-70. The car was effectively a rebadged D6-60S, which in turn was a derivation of the D6-60. The D6-70 sat on the same 3,150 mm (124 in) wheelbase as the D6-60 which was withdrawn from sale a few months after its launch. The car's straight-six engine was of 2729 cc displacement and was not shared with any Delage. Maximum output is listed as 78 hp (58 kW) though as before, sources differ. The D6-70 seems to have been the star of the Delage 6-cylinder range at this time, with some particularly elegant bodies provided such as the "Coach Panoramique" 2-door sports saloon from Letourneur & Marchand, a Chapron cabriolet bodied car depicted in the 1937 Delage catalogue and a particularly well balanced "Berline" (saloon/sedan) from Autobineau.
