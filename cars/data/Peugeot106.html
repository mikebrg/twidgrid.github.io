The Peugeot 106 is a popular and long-running city car (supermini) produced from 1991 to 2003, widely recognized for its agile handling, low running costs, and strong popularity as a first car and a platform for performance models like the 106 Rallye and GTi. <p>Overview<p>The 106 was the entry point into the Peugeot range for over a decade. It was praised for its nimble and fun driving experience, which earned it a strong following among enthusiasts. Designed primarily for European markets, it offered simple, robust mechanics and economical engines, making it a perfect urban runabout. <p>Key Variants<p>106 Rallye: A stripped-down, performance-focused version with stiffened suspension and steel wheels, celebrated for its pure driving dynamics.<p>106 GTi: The hot hatch variant, featuring a 1.6-litre 16V engine, body kit, and a more comfortable interior than the Rallye.<p>Electric (106 Électrique): A pioneering electric version was produced from 1995 to 2003, primarily for fleet use, long before mainstream electric vehicles became common. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>The 106 is a robust little car, but its age means that many have covered high mileages and require careful maintenance. <p>Rear Axle Wear: Like many Peugeots of this era (205, 306), the trailing arm bearings in the rear suspension are a major weak point. A sagging rear end or excessively positive camber (wheels tilting inwards at the bottom) indicates wear and a potentially costly repair if the axle beam needs replacing.<p>Head Gasket Failure: The 1.1L and 1.4L petrol engines, while generally reliable, are susceptible to head gasket failure, particularly if the cooling system is not meticulously maintained.<p>Rust: Corrosion can be an issue on older models, particularly around the rear wheel arches, sills, and front wings.<p>Electrical Issues: Minor electrical gremlins with central locking, intermittent wipers, and dashboard lights are common.<p>Clutch Cables: Clutch cables have been known to snap, so their condition should be monitored regularly. <p>Overall, the Peugeot 106 remains a cherished classic for its simplicity, lightweight design, and fun driving dynamics.
