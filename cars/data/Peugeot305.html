The Peugeot 305 is a large family car (D-segment) produced in Europe from 1977 to 1989. It was known for its comfortable ride, modern design for its time, and the introduction of Peugeot's new range of XU-series engines. <p>Overview and Design<p>The 305 was designed to fill the gap between the smaller 304 and the executive 504 models. It was praised for its handling and comfort, which became a trademark of Peugeot cars of that era. The car was available as a 4-door saloon and a 5-door estate (SW), the latter offering practicality with a large boot space and versatile folding seats. <p>Styling: Its design was a collaborative effort between Peugeot's in-house team and Pininfarina, resulting in a clean, angular look that was popular at the time.<p>Engine Innovation: It was one of the first models to feature Peugeot's all-new XU engines (which included the XU5 and XU9 found in the iconic 205 GTI) in its larger 1.6L and 1.9L versions, which were known for their reliability and efficiency. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>As a vehicle that ceased production decades ago, condition is highly dependent on prior maintenance. When new, the 305 was generally considered reliable, with a few common areas of concern for owners of surviving classics:<p>Rust: Corrosion is the most significant issue for these older vehicles, particularly on sills, wheel arches, and the underbody. The estate version was more prone to rust than the saloon.<p>Engine Gaskets: The petrol engines, while robust, could be susceptible to head gasket failure if the cooling system was not meticulously maintained.<p>Suspension: While providing an excellent ride, the suspension components, particularly the front wishbone bushes, were prone to wear over time.<p>Fuel System: On older diesel models, owners should be aware of potential issues with fuel injectors and injection pumps due to age and potential wear.<p>The 305 remains a classic example of the dependable and comfortable French family cars of the late 1970s and 1980s.
