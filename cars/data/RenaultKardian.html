The vehicle is based on the third-generation Dacia Sandero, and mainly sold in Latin America, South Africa and Ukraine (East Europe).<p>Overview<p>The Kardian is built on a new iteration of the CMF architecture, called RMP (Renault Modular Platform). It shares some parts with the third generation Dacia Sandero, and the dashboard with the Renault Taliant. It is manufactured since November 2023 in Curitiba, Brazil for the South American market, and from late 2024 in Casablanca, Morocco for North African, Middle Eastern and Eastern Europe markets (Ukraine, Moldova).<p>Design<p>During the presentation of the model, Gilles Vidal, the design director, emphasized that the Kardian was the result of joint work between the Renault styling teams in France and Brazil.<p>Powertrain<p>A new 125 hp (93 kW) flexfuel engine debuts, an evolution of the 1.0 TCe found on the Sandero. For the first time, this engine can be equipped with an all-new dual-clutch automatic transmission (codename DW23), which is due to be available in Europe with the launch of the third-generation Duster, scheduled for spring 2024.<p>In some countries such as Mexico, the Kardian is powered by a 1.6-litre engine producing 114 PS (112 hp; 84 kW).
