The Peugeot 207 is a supermini car produced from 2006 to 2014, available in hatchback, station wagon (SW), and coupe convertible (CC) body styles, known for its style and economy on the used market. <p>Overview<p>The Peugeot 207 was the successor to the highly popular Peugeot 206 and was built on the PSA PF1 platform, which it shared with the Citroën C3. It met with mixed reviews during its production run, with some praising its styling and safety, while others criticized its interior quality, gearbox, and handling. It was the sixth best-selling car in Britain in 2007. <p>Common Problems & Reliability<p>While generally considered reliable if well-maintained, the Peugeot 207 has some common issues. <p>Engine Issues: The 1.6 VTi and 1.6 THP engines, co-developed with BMW, are known for potential timing chain problems and oil/coolant leaks if not regularly serviced.<p>Electrical Faults: Owners have reported issues with alternators (especially in older models), dashboard displays, and the complex mechanisms of the CC's retractable roof and power windows.<p>Mechanical Wear: Suspension damper and wheel bearing failures have been reported, as well as problems with the trunk opening mechanism on the SW and CC variants.<p>Gearbox: The five-speed manual gearbox was often criticized for its quality, with a superior six-speed manual introduced later in the model's life. <p>Regular maintenance, especially addressing common wear points and ensuring up-to-date servicing (including checking injector seals on HDi engines), is crucial for longevity. The estimated lifespan for a well-maintained Peugeot 207 is around 156,000 miles.
