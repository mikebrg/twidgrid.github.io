The Peugeot Rifter is a versatile and practical van-based people carrier that has transitioned to an all-electric vehicle (EV) in many markets (known as the Peugeot e-Rifter), focusing on family-friendly practicality and generous interior space. <p>Key Features<p>The Rifter is built on Peugeot's modular EMP2 platform and is available in two lengths, "Standard" and "Long", offering flexible seating configurations and impressive cargo capacity. <p>Design and Modularity: It features a robust, SUV-inspired exterior design with increased ground clearance. The interior is highly adaptable, with options for 5 or 7 seats and individual folding rear seats. The front passenger seat can also be folded flat to accommodate long items up to 3 meters in the Long version.<p>Practicality: A key highlight is its vast storage space, including numerous cubbies and an impressive boot capacity ranging from 775 litres to a maximum of 4,000 litres with the rear seats folded down in the Long version. It also features convenient sliding side doors and an optional opening rear tailgate window.<p>Technology: The Rifter incorporates the PEUGEOT i-Cockpit, which includes a compact steering wheel, a head-up display, and an 8-inch or 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.<p>Safety: It performed well in Euro NCAP safety tests, with good protection against whiplash and effective autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems. <p>Engine Options<p>While earlier models offered a range of petrol and diesel engines, in many regions, the Rifter is now solely available as the all-electric e-Rifter. <p>Peugeot e-Rifter (Electric): This version is equipped with a 100 kW (136 hp) electric motor and a 50 kWh battery, offering a WLTP range of approximately 280 km (around 170 miles). It supports fast DC charging up to 100 kW, allowing a 10 to 80% charge in about 26 minutes.<p>Combustion Engines (Older/Specific Markets): For those looking at used models or in specific markets, the Rifter was available with 1.2-litre petrol (110 hp) and 1.5-litre diesel engines (75 hp, 100 hp, and 130 hp). Reviewers often recommend the more powerful diesel units for the best blend of pulling power and fuel economy. <p>Availability<p>The Peugeot Rifter is a popular choice in European and other markets, and its all-electric variant is widely available across these regions. It shares its platform and design with the Citroën Berlingo and Vauxhall Combo Life/Opel Combo Life.
