Chatenet Stella
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
Produced by Automobiles Chatenet, a French manufacturer founded in 1984. The firm specializes in voitures sans permis (cars without conventional driver-license requirements in some countries) and microcars. <p> The Stella is an older model (no longer in production) among Chatenet’s line-up. It’s considered a legacy/“historic” model now.<p>Key Specifications & Features<p>Here are some of the specifications of the Stella, especially in early variants (e.g. Stella 214):<br>Length / Size	~ 250 cm length, ~ 140 cm width, ~ 137 cm height <br>Weight (unladen)	~ 440 kg <br>Seats - Typically intended for 1 person in some versions. (Yes, just one!) <br>Engine / Power	~ 505 cc, 2 cylinders in line, Diesel. Power ~ 4 kW (≈ 5 HP) <br>Top Speed	~ 45 km/h (legally limited for many “voiture sans permis” / light quadricycle classifications) <br>Transmission	Automatic / continuously variable in many versions. <br>Fuel / Emissions	Diesel, with older emissions standards (Euro 2 in early models) <p>Legal / Use Implications<br>Because of its speed limit and classification, the Stella in many jurisdictions can be driven with a lighter class of license (or in some cases a moped-license) rather than a full car license. It depends heavily on the country’s rules for quadricycles légers / light quadricycles / voiture sans permis. <br>
Insurance, registration, and usage cost tend to be lower. Maintenance is simpler given the modest mechanics. But being an older model, parts availability may be more limited.<p>Strengths & Weaknesses<br>Pros: Very compact — useful in city / tight spaces<br>
Low speed / low power makes it safer for low speed traffic<br>Lower costs: fuel, licensing, insurance (depending on country)<br>Stylish / “cute” niche appeal; good if you want something quirky or unique<p>Cons: Very limited power / speed — not good for anything beyond very local driving<br>Comfort may be basic (minimal features)<br>Age & availability of parts could be an issue<br>Resale value could be low, obscure model for buyers
