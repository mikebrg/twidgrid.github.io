Also introduced in time for 1936 was the Delage D6-80. Initially this was powered by a 3227 cc in line 6-cylinder engine for which maximum power of 72 hp (54 kW) is listed. The D6-80 was a long vehicle. Like other Delages at this time the D6-80 shared its wheelbase – in this case of 3,350 mm (132 in) – with a Delahaye. In the case of cars and the accompanying information presented at the 1936 motor show for 1937 cars, the Delage D6-80 also shared its 3557 cc six-cylinder 90 hp (67 kW) engine with a Delahaye, although the switch to a Delahaye engine was not immediately implemented in respect of the cars provided for sale.<p>By 1938 the D6-80 had disappeared from the Delage range.
