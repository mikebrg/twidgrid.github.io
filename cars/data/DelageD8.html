Delage D8
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The Delage D8 was an eight-cylinder luxury car produced by Delage between 1929 and 1940.<p>The 4061 cc engine with a bore of 77 mm, and a stroke of 109 mm of the original D8 placed it in the 23CV car tax band which also defined its position high up in the market hierarchy.<p>Delage provided rolling chassis to be bodied and fitted out by prestigious carroussiers such as Letourneur et Marchand and Chapron operating (in most cases) in the Paris area. The result was that the D8 appeared, throughout its life, in a wide variety of (frequently) elegant coupé, cabriolet, sedan/saloon or roadster shapes.<p>Chronology<p>The D8 was introduced late in 1929 as a replacement for the opulent Delage GLS, but in view of the range of body types (and, subsequently, of engine sizes) with which it was offered it can also be seen as a replacement for some versions of the Delage DM.<p>It was launched when the European economy was still reeling from the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crashes – though cars at this level were never intended to sell in large numbers. By taking sales from other top end auto-makers such as, in particular, Bugatti, the D8 became one of the best known products of what subsequently came to be known as a "golden age" for low-volume expensive and luxurious cars in France.<p>Chassis<p>Two versions of the D8 were launched: the "D8 Normale" and the short-wheelbase "D8 S".<p>The "D8 Normale" was offered in three different wheelbase lengths: 3,167 mm (124.7 in), 3,467 mm (136.5 in), and 4,066 mm (160.1 in) – which would accommodate body lengths of more than 5 meters. The short-wheelbase "D8 S" was optimized for manoeuvrability and handling in sports car applications.<p>Both versions were produced until 1933.<p>Engine<p>The "Delage D8" was powered by a straight 8 engine which was a first both for Delage and for the French auto-industry. The 4061cc engine featured an overhead centrally positioned camshaft and a listed maximum output of 102 hp (76 kW) at 3,500 rpm for the "D8 Normale" and 120 hp (89 kW) in the "D8 S" version. Power was delivered to the rear wheels through a four speed manual gear-box featuring synchromesh on the upper two ratios.<p>Although performance varied according to vehicle weight, top speed listed for the "D8 Normale" was 120 km/h (75 mph), with 130 km/h (82 mph) listed for the "D8 S".<p>Brakes and suspension<p>The drum brakes operated on all four wheels. Suspension was traditional, involving rigid axles front and back with semi-elliptic leaf springs and "friction dampers".
