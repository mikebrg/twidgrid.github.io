The Peugeot 302 is a mid-weight saloon that was produced for a short time between 1936 and 1938, known for its streamlined styling with headlights integrated behind the front grille, a design cue it shared with the larger Peugeot 402. <p>Overview and Design<p>The 302 was introduced at the 1936 Paris Motor Show as a shortened, smaller-engined version of the popular Peugeot 402. It featured an aerodynamic design with flowing lines and innovative integrated headlights, a style referred to as the "Sochaux spindle". This design was a modern response to the automotive trends of the time, providing superior road holding and comfort with its independent front suspension. Approximately 25,083 units were produced during its short 18-month production life, with availability from inventory until mid-1938. <p>Features<p>Integrated Headlights: A distinctive styling feature was the placement of the headlights behind the sloping front grille, which enhanced aerodynamics.<p>Independent Front Suspension: The 302 offered independent front suspension, a technical advance over many competitors at the time, which led to better road handling and comfort.<p>Special Bodied Versions: In addition to the standard saloon and factory cabriolet, a small number of special coach-built versions were produced, including a Darl'mat-built roadster and a coupé-cabriolet with a patented automatic fold-away steel roof.<p>Engine Details: The 1.8L engine was similar to the one used in the larger 402, delivering power to the rear wheels via a traditional three-speed manual gearbox.
