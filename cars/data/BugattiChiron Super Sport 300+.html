On 8 September 2019, Bugatti presented a limited production high performance variant of the Chiron called the Chiron Super Sport 300+ to owners taking part in the company's 110th-anniversary tour in Europe. The variant is limited to 30 examples at a net unit price of 3.5 million euros. Changes from the standard Chiron include a more powerful engine, increased top speed, and a characteristic paint scheme featuring a lacquer-coated carbon fibre body with orange stripes, echoing the aesthetics of the company's previous top speed record-breaking cars, the Veyron Super Sport World Record Edition and the Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse World Record Car.<p>The car is powered by a 1,600 PS (1,175 kW; 1,580 hp) quad-turbocharged W16 engine shared with the Bugatti Centodieci, nicknamed "Thor". This car has a grey Bugatti logo made of black enamel and silver, the exhaust system from the Centodieci, a modified gearbox with longer ratios and front and rear bumpers optimised for aerodynamics at high speed, resulting in the overall length increase of the car by 248.9 mm (9.8 in).<p>The Super Sport 300+ was also equipped with a top speed limiter, akin to the one found in the standard Chiron. Without the limiter, Bugatti claimed the car could attain a maximum speed in excess of 483 km/h (300 mph), with 490 km/h (304.7 mph) being achieved in August 2019 with a pre-production model. Bugatti also prepared the cars of owners who want to take the car to its full potential at the Ehra-Lessien test track.<p>The first eight were delivered in September 2021.<p>Bugatti delivered the final Chiron Super Sport 300+ on 21 July 2022.
