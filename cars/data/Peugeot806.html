The Peugeot 806 is a large multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) produced from 1994 to 2002, known for its spacious, modular interior with sliding rear doors and being the result of a joint venture between PSA and Fiat. <p>Overview<p>Developed alongside the nearly identical Citroën Evasion, Fiat Ulysse, and Lancia Zeta (collectively known as the "Eurovans"), the 806 was designed to compete with the popular Renault Espace. Its key selling points were practicality and versatility. The sliding rear doors were a significant advantage in tight parking spaces, and the interior featured a flat floor with individual, removable seats that could be configured for 5 to 8 passengers, or removed entirely to create a vast cargo area of up to 3,300 liters. <p>Common Problems & Reliability<p>The Peugeot 806 generally has a good reputation for mechanical reliability, especially the diesel engines, but it is known for certain electrical and mechanical issues. <p>Electrical Gremlins: The most common issues are electrical, including faults with the central locking, immobiliser, and air conditioning systems.<p>Suspension Wear: Uneven front tyre wear may indicate suspension problems, which can be prone to wear and tear from heavy use.<p>Gearbox Synchromesh: The synchronizers on the manual gearbox, particularly second gear, can be a weak point and may grind if worn.<p>Brake and Engine Recalls: The car was subject to five recalls during its life, including potential issues with the ECU triggering airbags incorrectly and premature handbrake wear, so a service history verifying these were addressed is advisable.<p>Engine Coolant Leaks: Leaks have been known to cause expensive damage if not spotted early.
