Aixam e-Coupé Premium
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The Aixam e-Coupé Premium was produced from March 2017 to March 2020, marking a significant step in the evolution of electric microcars.
<p>This model was part of the Sensation series, which introduced a more dynamic design to Aixam's lineup. The e-Coupé Premium featured a 9 kW (12 hp) electric motor, allowing it to reach a top speed of 45 km/h—suitable for urban environments and compliant with European regulations for licence-free vehicles. With a 7.3 kWh lithium battery, it offered a range of up to 95 km on a full charge, making it ideal for daily commutes. Charging the battery took approximately 3.5 hours using a standard 2.2 kW AC charger. The vehicle's compact dimensions (3,000 mm length, 1,500 mm width, and 1,456 mm height) and lightweight design (440 kg) contributed to its agility and ease of parking in tight spaces. Inside, it provided seating for two passengers and came equipped with features like leather upholstery, a hands-free system, and alloy wheels. Safety features included rear parking sensors and an optional ABS system. The e-Coupé Premium was available in various metallic colors, including silver, titanium, blue, black, red, and pearl white, allowing for some personalization. 
<p>
Following its production run, the e-Coupé Premium was succeeded by newer models in Aixam's electric vehicle range, such as the e-Coupé Sport and e-Coupé GTi, which offered enhanced features and performance. Despite its discontinuation, the e-Coupé Premium remains a notable example of Aixam's commitment to providing eco-friendly, licence-free transportation options in Europe. Its blend of style, efficiency, and practicality continues to influence the design of subsequent models in the e-Aixam lineup.
