The Alpine A110 R (which stands for 'Radical') is a track-focused version that debuted on 4 October 2022, featuring a redesigned body kit and a more aggressive chassis setup.<p>It has been lightened and received performance upgrades, which helps it accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.9 seconds and can reach a top speed of 285 km/h.<p>The A110 R features a generous use of carbon fiber components, contributing to a weight reduction of 34 kilograms (75 pounds) and bringing the total weight down to 1,082 kilograms (2,385 pounds). Among the carbon fiber components are the hood with dual air ducts, the 18-inch wheels, the engine cover, and the Sabelt Track monocoque seats. Performance improvements include a 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) sprint time of 3.9 seconds, which is three-tenths of a second faster than the A110 S, and a top speed of 177 mph (285 km/h). Additionally, the A110 R features a stiffer suspension setup with adjustable dampers, allowing the ground clearance to be lowered by 10 millimeters (0.4 inches), and Brembo brakes with improved cooling. The dual exhaust system has been upgraded with a double wall produced using 3D printing to better isolate exhaust gases
