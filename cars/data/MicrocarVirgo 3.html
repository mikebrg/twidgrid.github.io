A petrol option was also available.<p>Design: Compared to its predecessors, the Virgo 3 received some stylistic updates. It maintained the two-seat, three-door hatchback body style characteristic of the Virgo line.<p>Variants: The Virgo 3 was offered in different trim levels and specialized versions, including the "Pratic" utility model designed for commercial use. Other trims like "Liberty" and "Luxe" were also available.<p>Legacy: The Virgo 3 marked the end of the long-running Virgo series, which helped Microcar establish a strong presence in the European license-exempt (or "sans permis") vehicle market. Following this, Microcar focused on its next generation of models, the MC series.
