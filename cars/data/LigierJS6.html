For 1984, the 50 cc JS4 was replaced by the similar JS6, which has a more rounded front, with squared off headlights and a faux grille in black plastic. The JS4's Motobécane engine was replaced by a more powerful 49 cc Derbi unit which reached the maximum possible 5 horsepower rating, while the JS6 was also offered with a 327 cc Ducati-VM diesel with the same power.
