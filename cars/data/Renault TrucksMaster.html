Renault Trucks Master

The Renault Master is a large van produced by the French manufacturer Renault since 1980, now in its fourth generation. It replaced the earlier Renault Super Goélette light trucks. It is also sold as the Nissan Interstar. Opel and Vauxhall have sold versions of the second and third series vans as the Opel Movano in Continental Europe and Vauxhall Movano in the United Kingdom. All four generations have been designed and manufactured by Renault, irrespective of the brand. Renault Trucks markets it as the Renault Trucks Master.<p>Over its lifetime, several different body styles have been available, from the standard van to bigger models with an increased load area, height, and longer wheelbases with an LWB prefix. Panel vans and crew vans are very common, but pickups are also available. Heavier duty models of the Master were also sold by (now Volvo owned) Renault Trucks as the B series, later as the Messenger and the Mascott.
