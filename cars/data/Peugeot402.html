The Peugeot 402 is a classic large family car produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot from 1935 to 1942, known for its distinctive streamlined design with headlights integrated behind the front grille and the innovation of being one of the world's first production cars available with a retractable hardtop. <p>Overview and Design<p>Unveiled at the 1935 Paris Motor Show, the 402 was part of Peugeot's "Sochaux spindle" design movement, a streamlined, Art Deco style inspired by the American Chrysler Airflow. The most notable design element was the placement of the headlights behind the curved front grille, an innovative aerodynamic solution for its time. This design was a commercial success, in contrast to the Chrysler Airflow. The 402 was also offered in a vast range of body styles and chassis lengths to cater to various consumer needs. <p>Noted Features and Variants<p>Retractable Hardtop "Éclipse": The Peugeot 402 Éclipse was one of the world's first production cars to feature an automatically folding steel roof, an innovation patented by Georges Paulin and a precursor to modern coupé-convertibles.<p>Darl'mat Versions: A limited run of high-performance coupé and roadster versions with special bodies by coachbuilder Pourtout were built by the Parisian dealer Émile Darl'mat. These achieved notable racing success, including a fifth-place finish overall at the 1938 24 Hours of Le Mans.<p>Wartime Adaptation: During World War II fuel shortages, many 402s were adapted to run on gazogène (charcoal-derived gas), with a boiler unit mounted at the rear.<p>Comfort and Innovation: The 402 offered a comfortable ride with independent front suspension and was noted for practical features like twin electric windscreen wipers and a large, spacious cabin advertised as a six-seater.
