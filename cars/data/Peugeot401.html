The Peugeot 401 is a mid-size car produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot in 1934 and 1935, primarily known for its limited-production "Eclipse" variant which was the world's first series-produced car with an electric retractable hardtop. <p>Overview and History<p>Introduced at the October 1934 Paris Motor Show, the Peugeot 401 was a mid-range model designed to slot between the smaller 301 and the range-topping 601. Production lasted less than a year, ending in August 1935, with a total of 13,545 units manufactured. While the majority of these were standard sedans, the car's most significant legacy is the innovative "Eclipse" version, designed by Georges Paulin and built by coachbuilder Pourtout, which featured an electrically operated folding metal roof. <p>Noted Features and the Eclipse Variant<p>Retractable Hardtop "Éclipse" The Peugeot 401 D Eclipse was the world's first series-produced car with an electric folding metal roof, an ingenious and highly advanced feature for its time.<p>Independent Front Suspension Like its predecessor the 201, the 401 featured independent front suspension, which improved road handling and was quickly adopted by competitors.<p>Interior The interior of the Eclipse model was designed with luxury in mind, aiming to attract affluent middle-class buyers with quality leather and a simple metal dash featuring a single dial.<p>Performance The 1.7L engine had its work cut out for it with the heavy bodywork of the Eclipse, and while it could reach about 100 km/h, the complex and heavy roof mechanism contributed to low sales for that specific variant (only 79 Eclipses were made).
