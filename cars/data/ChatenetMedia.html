The Media is one of the earlier models in Chatenet’s line of “without-licence” vehicles. It reflects the simpler, lighter designs before they moved to more modern styling and features in later models. <p>Because of its limitations (speed, engine output), it was mainly aimed at those needing minimal personal transport under regulations that permit driving with lighter licence or no full licence.<p>Technologically modest: automatic/CVT, simple features. Its lightweight construction and small engine helped meet regulatory requirements (both for licensing and safety/emissions) of its time.
