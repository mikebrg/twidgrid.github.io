DS 5
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The DS 5 is a subcompact executive hatchback which was designed and developed by the French automaker Citroën, and launched in the market in Europe in November 2011. It was the third model in the premium sub brand DS. Released as the Citroën DS5, the car was relaunched as the DS 5 in 2015, following Citroën's decision to rebadge its DS models and market them under the brand DS.<p>The DS5 was revealed at the 2011 Shanghai Auto Show in April 2011. Although Peugeot and Citroën products have shared platforms and principal components since the closing decades of the twentieth century, in 2011 the DS5 became the first Citroën-branded car to be assembled in Peugeot's lead European plant at Sochaux.<p>The DS5 mixes hatchback and estate styling, resembling a shooting-brake. It is 4,530 mm (178.3 in) long and 1,871 mm (73.7 in) wide, dimensions that are similar to those of the Lancia Delta. This is hardly a coincidence: the DS5 is based on the PF2 platform as 3008 is too, not on the C5 as its name could imply.<p>The DS5 fills the spot where the first generation C5 hatchback left off, as the current C5 no longer have hatchback versions. Like the original concept car, its interior is heavily aviation inspired and available with two centre consoles, one of which is located on the roof directly above the other.<p>With a head up display in front of the driver, the cabin is designed to resemble a jet aeroplane. Emphasising its link to aviation, and the original Citroën DS model, the carmaker partnered with the C-Forum fan club to recreate an old photoshoot of the car with a Concorde.<p>Buyers can choose between a turbocharged petrol, two diesel engines and PSA's diesel-electric Hybrid4. It marries a 163 hp 2.0 HDi diesel engine with a 37 hp (28 kW) electric motor mounted on the rear axle and sends the power to all four wheels as it is needed.<p>Depending on trim level, this powertrain emits 99g/km or 107g/km CO2, and the car can drive on electricity alone if the battery is sufficiently charged. The DS5 is the first Citroën with a hybrid drivetrain, and the first production car with a diesel electric hybrid drivetrain.<p>A hybrid convertible Citroën DS5 was chosen by François Hollande, for his investiture parade as President of France in May 2012.<p>The Citroën DS5 was relaunched as the DS 5, without Citroën badging, in 2015.<p>Awards<p>The DS5 Hybrid4 won Best Eco Car, from the Scottish Car of the Year 2012, held at Glasgow on 14 October 2012. The DS5 won Top Gear "Family Car of the Year 2011".
