The D6 3-litre came in its standard form with only one carburettor; in 1946 a performance version, the Delage D6 Olympic, was presented. The Olympic used the same engine block, but was fitted with a triple carburettor fuel feed system. This gave rise to an output of 100 hp (74 kW), now with the engine spinning up to 4,500 rpm, and corresponding with a top speed of approximately 140 km/h (87 mph). This may have been in connection with the 3-litre Delage racing cars which were much in evidence during the 1948 racing season. However, in 1949 this performance version of the D6 was withdrawn.
