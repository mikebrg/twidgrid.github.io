The “Barooder” was somewhat of a turning point in Chatenet’s line, representing a “maxi-mini” version, bridging size / comfort with the limitations of licence-free vehicles. <p>It helped Chatenet increase its market share substantially in the early 2000s: sales growth of +37% in 2003, then +110% in early 2004, were in part attributed to Barooder’s launch.
