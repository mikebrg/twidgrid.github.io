As the company succumbed to its financial difficulties, in April 1935 the plant at Courbevoie, which Delage had occupied since 1910, produced its last car, and the process began which would leave Delage as a simple affiliate of Delahaye by 1938. In 1935 Delage retained a separate management, but production was transferred to the Delahaye factory, in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. The Delage range was rearranged in order to facilitate the sharing of production facilities.<p>As part of this process, the Delage D6-65 was replaced by the Delage D6-60. It was available only with a 3,150 mm (124 in) wheelbase, shared with the four-cylinder Delayahe Models such as the 134N. Delages retained their own engine designs and the D6-60 came with a straight 6 of 2335 cc which was increased to 2528 cc at the Motor Dhow in October 1936 in time for the 1937 model year. Maximum power now rose from 56 hp (42 kW) to 67 hp (50 kW) at 3,500 rpm. At the end of 1937 the D6-60 was taken out of production.
