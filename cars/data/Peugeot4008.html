The Peugeot 4008 has existed in two distinct forms: the first was a compact crossover SUV (2012-2017) developed in collaboration with Mitsubishi, and the second is a current-generation, China-exclusive SUV based on the Peugeot 3008, produced by Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën Automobiles. <p>First Generation (2012-2017)<p>The first 4008 was a compact crossover SUV developed as a joint venture with Mitsubishi Motors, based on the same platform as the Mitsubishi ASX and Citroën C4 Aircross. It was sold in various markets including Australia, Russia, South Africa, and parts of Europe, but not in all, like the UK or Italy. <p>Engine Options:<p>1.6L Petrol: 117 hp.<p>2.0L Petrol (select markets): 148 hp or 150 hp.<p>1.6L HDi Diesel: 115 hp.<p>1.8L HDi Diesel: 150 hp.<p>Drivetrain: To avoid internal competition with the Peugeot 3008 at the time, the first-generation 4008 was mainly offered in an all-wheel-drive (4x4) configuration in Europe, with a system featuring three selectable driving modes (2WD, 4WD, and Lock).<p>Design: It featured a distinctively Peugeot exterior design with a vertical grille and LED daytime running lights, despite the underlying Japanese engineering. <p>Second Generation (2016-Present)<p>The second generation of the Peugeot 4008 was introduced in 2016 and is sold exclusively in China. This model is essentially a long-wheelbase version of the second-generation European Peugeot 3008, built on the EMP2 platform. <p>Design and Interior: It boasts a longer wheelbase (2,735 mm compared to the European 3008's 2,670 mm), providing more interior room. It features the second-generation PEUGEOT i-Cockpit with a compact steering wheel, an 8-inch touchscreen, and a 12.3-inch head-up display.<p>Engine Options (China Market):<p>1.6L THP Turbo Petrol: 165 hp.<p>1.8L THP Turbo Petrol: 204 hp.<p>Availability: This version is produced and sold only in China and is not available in other global markets. <p>The model name is distinct from the current Peugeot 408, which is a separate fastback sedan model offered in global markets (including Europe).
