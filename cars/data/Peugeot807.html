The Peugeot 807 is a large multi-purpose vehicle (MPV, or people carrier) produced from 2002 to 2014, known for its emphasis on practicality, spacious interior, and safety features such as electric sliding rear doors. <p>Overview<p>Part of a joint venture with Citroën, Fiat, and Lancia (producing the C8, Ulysse, and Phedra respectively), the 807 was the successor to the Peugeot 806. It was designed as a no-nonsense family car, prioritizing passenger comfort and versatility. Key features include highly adjustable individual seats mounted on runners, a centrally mounted instrument cluster, and available electric sliding side doors that are particularly useful in tight parking spaces. The 807 achieved a five-star Euro NCAP safety rating. <p>Common Problems & Reliability<p>The Peugeot 807 generally has a good reputation for reliability, especially the diesel models, provided they are serviced regularly. Owners should be aware of potential issues with the complex electronics and certain mechanical components. <p>Electric Sliding Doors: The electric sliding doors, while a great feature, have been reported to have occasional problems with the mechanisms or electrical faults.<p>Electrical Gremlins: The multiplex wiring system, while enabling advanced features, can lead to various minor electrical issues, with the ECU (engine control unit) being a potential (though uncommon) source of costly problems if it goes haywire.<p>Suspension and Tires: Uneven front tire wear may indicate suspension trouble, which has been reported on some models.<p>DPF Issues: As with many diesel vehicles, the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) can cause problems if the car is primarily used for short, urban journeys where the filter cannot regenerate properly. <p>Overall, the diesel engines are generally seen as the "best buy" due to their performance and economy, and a car with a solid service history is highly recommended.
