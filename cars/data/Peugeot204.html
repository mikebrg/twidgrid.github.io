The Peugeot 204 is a small family car produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot between 1965 and 1976. It was a significant model for the company, being the first Peugeot to feature front-wheel drive and disc brakes. <p>Overview and Innovations<p>Launched at the Paris Motor Show in April 1965, the 204 was developed under "Project D12" to compete in the small to mid-size segment. Its advanced technical specifications, including a transversely mounted all-aluminum engine and fully independent suspension on all four wheels, made it a highly modern and successful vehicle for its era. It became the best-selling car in France from 1969 to 1971. <p>Noted Reviews and Features<p>Handling and Ride The 204 was praised for its good road handling and comfortable ride, attributed to its independent suspension system with anti-roll bars.<p>Fuel Economy The diesel versions, which featured what was at the time possibly the world's smallest diesel engine in a production car, offered "startlingly good" fuel economy.<p>Interior Space The transverse engine layout allowed for increased passenger space within its compact dimensions, and reviewers noted the deep, comfortable seats and ample legroom.<p>Practicality The estate and van versions were highly successful due to their practicality and large cargo capacity.<p>Austerity Some reviewers noted that the finish and equipment could be austere for the price, but generally found the car to be a well-made and capable family vehicle.
