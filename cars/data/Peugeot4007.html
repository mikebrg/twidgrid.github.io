The Peugeot 4007 was a compact crossover SUV produced between 2007 and 2012 as part of a joint venture with Mitsubishi Motors. It was essentially a rebadged version of the second-generation Mitsubishi Outlander, with a distinctively styled front fascia and the French company's own diesel engine. <p>Key Features and Specifications<p>The 4007 was a 5-door SUV designed to be a capable soft-roader, offering practicality with a versatile seating arrangement. <p>Seating: It featured a flexible 5+2 seating layout, with a rigid folding bench in the third row suitable mainly for children or short adult journeys.<p>Practicality: The second-row seats could slide and recline for comfort and folded flat to expand the generous boot space. The two-piece tailgate, with a lower part that folded down to act as a bench supporting up to 200 kg, was a practical feature for loading.<p>Drivetrain: It offered three drive modes:<p>2WD (front-wheel drive): For dry tarmac driving and best fuel efficiency.<p>4WD (automatic four-wheel drive): Distributed power as needed between the front and rear wheels for optimal traction.<p>4WD locked mode: Sent 50% more torque to the rear wheels at low speeds on loose surfaces for critical traction. <p>Engine Options<p>Peugeot primarily offered their own diesel engine in most markets, while Mitsubishi petrol engines were available in others, notably Russia and some European countries. <p>The 2.2L diesel engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or an optional 6-speed Dual Clutch System (DCS) automatic transmission. <p>Market and Discontinuation<p>The Peugeot 4007, along with its twin the Citroën C-Crosser, were the first Japanese-produced cars sold under any French brand. The model was discontinued in 2012 due to lower-than-expected sales, and it was succeeded by the Peugeot 4008 in some markets.
