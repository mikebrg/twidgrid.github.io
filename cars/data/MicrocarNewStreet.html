The Microcar Newstreet was a mini-roadster model produced by the French manufacturer Microcar. It was particularly notable for its open-top, buggy-style design, a departure from the company's more conventional microcar bodies. <p>Key details about the Newstreet:
Production: The Newstreet was launched around 1995 and was aimed at younger drivers. Its production run lasted about a decade, until approximately 2005.<p>Style: Unlike many other microcars designed for basic utility, the Newstreet was known for its stylish, fun-focused aesthetic. Its "mini-roadster" and "buggy" appeal was part of a shift by microcar makers to attract a wider and younger demographic.<p>Engine and licensing: As a microcar, the Newstreet was a low-powered vehicle that could be driven in many European countries with a reduced-category license (an AM license).<p>Legacy: The Newstreet was an important model in Microcar's history and helped establish the brand's reputation for producing a diverse range of vehicles. Following the Newstreet, Microcar focused on models like the Virgo and later the MC series before merging with Ligier.
