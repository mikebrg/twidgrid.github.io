Peugeot Boxer

The Peugeot Boxer is a large commercial van produced since 1996, highly valued for its robust design, high payload capacity (up to 2 tonnes), and availability in a range of sizes and powertrains, including an all-electric version. <p>Features and Design<p>The Boxer is the largest model in Peugeot's van lineup and shares a platform with the Citroën Relay, Fiat Ducato, and Vauxhall Movano (part of the Stellantis group). It is built for demanding professional use, with several features to aid productivity and ease of use. <p>Load Capacity & Access: The Boxer offers a wide range of load volumes, from 8 m³ to 17 m³, and a payload capacity of up to 2 tonnes. It has a low loading sill (between 493mm and 602mm) and wide-opening rear doors (up to 270 degrees) to facilitate easy loading and unloading.<p>Dimensions: It is available in four load lengths (L1 to L4) and three roof heights (H1 to H3), offering a floor width between wheel arches optimized at 1.42 meters. This makes it highly adaptable for various professional needs.<p>Technology: Modern Boxer models feature the PEUGEOT i-Cockpit, a new dashboard design, advanced driving aids, and connectivity features like a 10-inch HD touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. <p>Powertrain Options<p>The Boxer offers both internal combustion and electric powertrains. <p>Diesel: The diesel range uses a proven 2.2-litre BlueHDi engine, shared across the Stellantis large van range, with power outputs ranging from 120 hp to 165 hp. These are paired with manual transmissions.<p>Electric (e-Boxer): The new electric E-Boxer has a range of up to 410 km WLTP (on certain versions) and supports rapid charging at up to 100 kW DC. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>The Boxer is generally considered a reliable workhorse, with many older models still providing good service, particularly the HDi diesels. <p>Electrical Issues: As with many modern vans, the Boxer can experience electrical issues, including problems with the wiper functionality, lights, and general system glitches.<p>Engine & DPF Issues: Diesel models are prone to Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) blockages if used primarily for short urban trips. Issues with EGR valve failure, turbochargers (often from poor oil maintenance), and AdBlue systems have also been reported.<p>Suspension and Brakes: Front suspension components can wear out, and brakes may wear quickly under heavy loads. Handbrake cable issues have also been noted.<p>Water Ingress: Water getting into the engine compartment has been known to cause injector and other electrical problems. <p>Regular maintenance and timely servicing are crucial for the longevity of the Peugeot Boxer.
