The Peugeot J9 is a classic light commercial van and minibus that was manufactured by Peugeot in France from 1981 to 1991, and under license by Karsan in Turkey until 2010. <p>Overview<p>Succeeding the Peugeot J7, the J9 was designed with a "forward control" setup, where the cabin sits above the engine. This layout maximized load space. The van was available in various body styles, including panel vans and minibuses, and offered different payload capacities, such as 1,400 kg or 1,800 kg versions. It featured practical solutions like a wide-opening sliding side door and rear barn doors. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>As a vehicle designed in the late 1970s and produced into the 2000s, the J9 is known for its robust, simple mechanicals, but is susceptible to age-related issues. <p>Rust: Corrosion is the primary concern for these older vans, typically appearing on sills, wheel arches, and the underbody.<p>Engine & Mechanics: The engines are generally durable, with the diesel variants being particularly long-lasting if maintained. However, owners should monitor for potential fuel delivery issues in older diesels.<p>Maintenance: Due to their age, surviving examples require diligent maintenance to remain operational. They are often converted into catering vans or motorhomes due to their spacious interiors and high headroom, with conversions often involving extensive electrical and structural modifications.<p>Availability of Parts: While many mechanical parts were shared with other Peugeot models like the 504 and 505 (and even the 309 for seats in later models), sourcing specific body panels or unique components may be challenging today.
