Delage D8-15
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
In 1933 Delage introduced the D8-15 in which the size of the 8-cylinder engine had been reduced to 2,668 cc (162.8 cu in). The "-15" suffix referred to the 15 CV car tax band in which the smaller engine placed the car. The lesser performance of this version of the Delage D8 moved the model downmarket in the direction of volume automakers such as Citroën who were already working on a 16 CV six-cylinder version of their newly introduced Traction Avant model (although the project seems to have been a low priority for Citroën and the car in question would only appear in the market, initially very cautiously, in June 1938).<p>The 15CV Delage D8, like the original 23CV version, was produced both in “-Normale" versions and in a shorter wheelbase “-S" version. However, the Delage D8-15 had been withdrawn by the end of 1934.
