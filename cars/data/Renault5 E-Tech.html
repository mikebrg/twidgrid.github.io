Renault 5 E-Tech
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The Renault 5 E-Tech is a B-segment battery electric car produced by the French manufacturer Renault since 2024. Inspired by the original Renault 5 in styling, the 5 E-Tech was previewed by a concept car shown in January 2021, with the production model being officially unveiled at the Geneva International Motor Show in February 2024.<p>History<p>Development<p>Development of the Renault 5 E-Tech began from an orange life-size design mockup that was presented to Renault CEO Luca de Meo at the Renault Technocentre in Guyancourt in July 2020. The mockup was merely an exploratory study by a designer, François Leboine for a small electric car that was rejected as the company was not looking to produce a retro car. The mockup caught the attention of De Meo, which asked the design team to turn it into a prototype car. By October 2020, the prototype was completed. The prototype was showcased as the Renault 5 Prototype, and became a symbol of Renault's electric car strategy called Renaulution, which was announced on 14 January 2021.<p>In his short memoir about the Renault 5, De Meo emphasized the need of having at least one model that "express their DNA more than any of the others", citing the Fiat 500, Volkswagen Golf, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Renault Twingo as examples. De Meo personally oversaw the development and organized intense critical discussions that led to some design changes, with an employee calling the car the "boss's car" that they "couldn’t afford to make mistakes".<p>Renault had to drastically reduce the normal development time for the Renault 5 from four years to three years, which it achieved by using the CMF-B platform as the base. Around 1,100 parts was used to build the vehicle, many of which are shared with other CMF-B vehicles such as the Clio V. The platform is also used by the Renault 4.<p>In October 2022, Renault unveiled its "industrial metaverse" at the Flins plant in Yvelines, which is being transformed to become the Re-Factory. Among the technologies on display was a simulation of a virtual reality paint booth, with the vehicle rendered in 3D for the demonstration being the production version of the Renault 5 EV, the first time it has been shown without camouflage.<p>In March 2023, journalists had the opportunity to test a development mule of the production version, scheduled for a release in 2024. 'Vehicle check' prototypes, using near-final bodies and chassis, were tested starting in July 2023. These prototypes also serve to test the production processes. Prior development prototypes used Clio bodies on the CMF-BEV platform.<p>Concept car<p>An electric Renault 5 was announced in January 2021 as part of Groupe Renault's strategic plan "Renaulution" covering the period 2021–2025+; the Renault marque has branded their effort "Nouvelle Vague" (New Wave), with the goal of offering the most complete electrified and hydrogen fuel cell lineup by 2025.<p>The R5 prototype uses a small battery electric variant of the Renault–Nissan Common Module Family platform, initially designated CMF–B EV and later named AmpR Small. CMF–B EV will be used in additional forthcoming small cars, including an electric version of a revived Renault 4. Renault initially denied the 5 EV would replace the Zoe, but later reversed their stance. Standardization of the platform and battery technology is expected to reduce production costs by 33% compared to the Zoe, as many components are reused from the CMF-B platform used in the Clio V. The Renault 5 EV will share its platform with the upcoming Nissan Micra EV.
