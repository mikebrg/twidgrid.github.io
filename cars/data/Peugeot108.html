The Peugeot 108 was a compact and efficient city car produced from 2014 to 2021 as a joint venture with Citroën and Toyota. It is no longer available as a new vehicle, but used models remain popular due to their affordability and low running costs. <p>Overview and Features<p>The Peugeot 108 was part of a trio of city cars, sharing its platform, engines, and electrics with the Citroën C1 and Toyota Aygo. It was known for its stylish exterior, customizable options, and suitability for urban driving. <p>Body Styles: Available as a 3-door or 5-door hatchback, with an optional "Top!" version featuring an electric retractable fabric roof.<p>Interior and Tech: The cabin offered modern technology for its class, including a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth, USB connectivity, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto (available after a 2018 update). Higher trims featured a reversing camera and keyless entry.<p>Practicality: Despite its compact size (length 3.46 meters), it had a decent boot capacity of 196 litres, expandable to 868 litres with the rear seats folded.
Safety: It included safety features like Active City Brake (an automatic emergency braking system operating at speeds less than 20 mph) and a Lane Departure Warning System on certain trims. <p>Engine Options and Performance<p>The Rifter was only available with petrol engines, known for their fuel efficiency. <p>Reviewers praised the small 1.0L engine for its exceptional fuel efficiency (up to 58.9 mpg WLTP), making it an ideal choice for new or budget-conscious drivers. <p>Discontinuation and Market<p>Production of the Peugeot 108 ended on January 1, 2022, following Toyota's full acquisition of the TPCA joint venture plant in the Czech Republic. There has been no direct successor announced for the model. As a result, the Peugeot 108 is now only available as a used vehicle, where plenty of examples can be found across various markets.
