The Peugeot 404 is a durable and elegant large family car produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot from 1960 to 1975 in Europe, with licensed production continuing in other countries like Kenya until 1991. Designed by Pininfarina, it was highly regarded for its robust build, comfortable ride, and reliability, especially as a popular taxicab and rally car in tough conditions. <p>Overview and Reputation<p>The Peugeot 404 was introduced as a successor to the Peugeot 403, featuring more modern, angular styling with subtle tailfins that were a characteristic of its designer, the Italian firm Pininfarina. The car was a global success, proving exceptionally capable in diverse environments, from European roads to the rugged terrains of Africa and South America. It built a strong reputation for durability, which was further cemented by its success in endurance rallies, such as the East African Safari Rally, which it won four times in the 1960s. <p>Noted Features and User Experience<p>Ride Quality and Handling Reviewers consistently praised the 404's "outstanding" ride quality and excellent isolation from road noise, even on poor surfaces, a result of its helical springs and hydraulic telescopic shock absorbers. While body roll was present with its soft suspension, the car was noted for its good road holding and responsive handling.<p>Interior Comfort The car featured comfortable, fully adjustable, and often reclining front seats, along with a spacious interior and a large boot (trunk), making it suitable for families and use as a taxi.<p>Fuel Injection The availability of Kugelfischer mechanical fuel injection as an option was an advanced feature for a family car of its class and era, offering increased power and efficiency.<p>Global Workhorse The 404's simple mechanics and rigid construction made it a reliable workhorse in many parts of the world. Its diesel versions were particularly popular for their "startlingly good" fuel economy and longevity, often covering hundreds of thousands of kilometers.<p>Collectibility The coupé and convertible versions, with their elegant, distinct Pininfarina-built bodies, are the most rare and sought-after models among collectors today.
