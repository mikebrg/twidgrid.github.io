The Bugatti Mistral, also called the Bugatti W16 Mistral, is a mid-engine two-seater sports car manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. It was revealed on 19 August 2022. The Mistral is the fastest roadster in the world with a top speed achievement of 453.91 km/h (282 mph) in November 2024. Deliveries to customers will begin in early 2024. All 99 units were pre-sold at a price of €5 million.<p>The Mistral is not a cabriolet version of the Bugatti Chiron but rather a separate roadster model for Bugatti that marks the last vehicle to use the W16 engine that was introduced with the Bugatti Veyron in 2005.<p>The exterior design is unique to the Mistral and is not based on the Chiron or the latest Bugatti models. It is highly aerodynamic and sport-orientated, but nevertheless maintains a luxurious interior. The front headlights are uniquely designed with four diagonal lighting strips, while the rear lights are designed as two arrows pointing to the Bugatti symbol, which is also part of the lighting. Unlike the exterior, the passenger cabin is based on that of the Chiron, except for the gear lever, which features a Dancing Elephant sculpture, embedded in amber, designed by sculptor Rembrandt Bugatti, brother of Ettore Bugatti, the founder of Bugatti.
