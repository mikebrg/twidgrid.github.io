The Peugeot 601 was the brand's range-topping, luxury car produced for a short time between 1934 and 1935, notable for being Peugeot's return to six-cylinder engines and offering one of the world's first power-operated retractable hardtops in its "Éclipse" variant.<p>Overview and Legacy<p>Launched in May 1934, the 601 was designed to compete in the luxury vehicle segment, filling a gap that would remain empty in Peugeot's lineup for 40 years until the introduction of the Peugeot 604. It shared the distinctive "Sochaux spindle" aerodynamic styling with integrated headlights with the smaller 401 and 402 models. The 601 was considered elegant and comfortable, though its performance was limited by its engine output relative to the car's weight. Despite a short production run of approximately 3,999 units, its "Éclipse" model secured a place in automotive history as a pioneer in convertible roof technology. <p>Noted Features<p>Retractable Hardtop "Éclipse": The very limited-production 601 Éclipse, with a body built by coachbuilder Pourtout, featured an electrically folding metal roof that stowed into the boot, a pioneering innovation in automotive design.<p>Engine Innovations: A notable feature was a thermostatically controlled engine oil temperature regulator which redirected oil through a heat exchanger in the radiator, an advanced engineering detail for the era.<p>Comfort and Style: The car was praised for its elegance, luxurious comfort, and good road holding due to its independent front suspension.<p>Rarity and Collectibility: Due to its limited production and historical significance, the 601, particularly the Éclipse variant, is an extremely rare and sought-after classic car today.
