A 207 hp (154 kW) version, the DS3 Racing, was introduced at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. It is the road version of Citroën's rally specification car DS3 R3. The new 0-62 mph time is 6.5 seconds and the increased top speed is 146 mph (235 km/h).<p>The DS3 Racing was offered in only two colours, white with grey accents or black with orange accents including roof, wheels and interior. Besides these unique colour schemes, the DS3 Racing is distinguished from other trim levels by the use of real carbon fibre on the front splitter, grill, wheel arches and rear diffuser. Additionally, carbon fibre is prominently featured on the interior.<p>In October 2011, Citroën announced that they were planning on building a total of 2,400 DS3 Racings, significantly more than the 1,000 initially planned in 2010.<p>The Citroën DS3 WRC was used by the Citroën World Rally Team in WRC competitions between 2011 and 2016.
