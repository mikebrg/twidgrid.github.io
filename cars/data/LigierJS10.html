Ligier also developed a longer truck version with a 350 kg (772 lb) payload, with a pickup bed or a cargo box, called the JS10. First shown at the end of 1983, the JS10 was fitted with a larger, 430 cc diesel engine with 8 hp (5.9 kW) and a top speed of about 75 km/h (47 mph). Its overall length increased to 2.65 m (104 in). The Ligier JS10 was under consideration with the PTT for replacing their large fleet of Piaggio Ape three-wheeled trucks, and a militarized version was also planned.
