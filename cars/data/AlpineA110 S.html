Alpine A110 S
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
Introduced in June 2019, the A110 S is a high performance and lightweight variant of the A110. The A110 S benefits from increased power output (from 252 to 300 PS (185 to 221 kW; 249 to 296 hp)) from its 1.8-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine as well as stiffer springs, new anti-rollbars, dampers, and high performance brakes. The ride height is lowered by 4 mm (0.16 in) and the car is fitted with special Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tyres having a stickier compound contributing to more grip on the tarmac.<p>The engine was retuned and a larger turbocharger installed. The peak power is achieved at 1400 rpm higher than the standard engine. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission remains unchanged. The new springs and anti-roll bars are respectively 50 and 100 percent stiffer than the standard car. The ESC system has also been retuned to improve handling and comes with a full-defeat mode.<p>Aesthetic changes include flag motifs, orange brake calipers and optional matte grey paintwork and lighter Fuchs alloy wheels. An optional carbon fibre roof with a gloss finish reduces 1.9 kg (4 lb) from the total weight of the car which is 1,114 kg (2,456 lb).<p>The A110 S can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.4 seconds (0.1 seconds faster than the standard car) and has an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph).
