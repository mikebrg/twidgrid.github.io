The Zenvo TSR is a track-only version of the TS1 GT. Launched alongside the TS1 GT at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, the TSR shares most of its mechanical components with the road-legal car, including the same engine and body.<p>The main changes in the TSR variant are a 250 kg (551 lb) of weight reduction reducing the total weight to 1,330 kg (2,932 lb), revised gearing and power delivery for track use, and a fixed carbon-fibre wing on the rear of the car. A larger carbon-fibre front splitter and rear diffuser have also been fitted to improve airflow at higher speeds. The TSR's interior includes a full roll cage and 6 point harnesses, with the infotainment system of the TS1 GT having been removed to save weight. As a result of the gearing and aerodynamic changes, the top speed of the TSR is reduced to 325 km/h (202 mph).
