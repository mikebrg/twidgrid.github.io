In April 2022, the French National Gendarmerie took delivery of 26 Alpine A110s built to police specification by specialist vehicle convertor Durisotti, replacing the fleet of Renault Mégane RS vehicles previously operated by the force. These vehicles, the first Alpines to be operated by the Gendarmerie since the A110s of the 1960s and A310s of the 1970s, were equipped with a singular roof light as well as other lighting, a variable message board on the rear of the vehicle, standard Gendarmerie radio equipment and reinforced seats in the interior and Sérac 18-inch wheel rims, with each A110 finished in Bleu Abysse with Gendarmerie reflective markings. A specially trained team of drivers was assembled by the National Gendarmerie to operate this first batch of A110s on the autoroutes of France. An A110 from this batch was rolled onto its roof in an accident along the A4 autoroute in Meuse shortly after delivery in July 2022.<p>A further batch of eleven Alpine A110 S models built to the same specification as the conventional A110s would later be delivered to the National Gendarmerie in 2023, placing the Gendarmerie's Alpine fleet at a total of 37 vehicles.
