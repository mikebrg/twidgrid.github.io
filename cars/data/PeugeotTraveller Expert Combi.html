The Peugeot Traveller and Peugeot Expert Combi are nearly identical multi-passenger vehicles based on the same platform, with the primary distinction often being in the trim levels and target markets (leisure/family vs. business/shuttle). In many markets, particularly Europe, these models are now available exclusively as the all-electric Peugeot e-Traveller and Peugeot e-Expert Combi. <p>Model Types and Modularity<p>Both vehicles share the same core design, dimensions, and engine options, prioritizing flexibility and passenger comfort. <p>Seating Configuration: Both are highly modular, offering configurations for 5, 7, 8, or up to 9 seats. The rear seats are typically independent, sliding on rails, and can be removed entirely to maximize cargo space.<p>Dimensions: They are available in different lengths, commonly "Standard" (around 4.96m) and "Long" (around 5.31m), while maintaining a consistent height of under 1.9m, which allows for easy access to most car parks.<p>Cargo Space: With all seats in place, they offer generous boot space (e.g., 989 liters in the Long version), expanding to a maximum capacity of over 3,000 liters (or up to 4,000 litres for the long version) with seats folded or removed. <p>Powertrain Options<p>In certain markets, older or specific trims of the Expert Combi might still be available with diesel engines, but the general trend, especially for newer models, is towards electrification. <p>Electric (e-Traveller / e-Expert Combi)<p>Motor: A single electric motor producing 100 kW (136 hp) and 260 Nm of torque.<p>Battery & Range: Two battery options are available:<p>50 kWh battery: Offers a WLTP range of approximately 220-230 km (around 143 miles).<p>75 kWh battery: Offers a longer WLTP range of up to 330 km (around 204 miles).<p>Charging: Supports 100 kW DC fast charging, allowing the battery to charge from 10 to 80% in about 30-45 minutes depending on battery size. <p>Diesel (Select Markets/Older Models)<p>Engine: A 2.0-litre BlueHDi diesel engine is often cited in specific markets or past models, with power outputs of around 150 hp or 180 hp.<p>Transmission: These models usually feature a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed EAT8 automatic transmission. <p>Interior and Technology<p>The interior is designed for comfort and functionality, whether for family trips or professional transport. <p>Infotainment: Features a 7-inch or 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system with DAB radio, Bluetooth, and smartphone integration (Apple CarPlay and Android Auto).<p>Comfort: Includes features like dual-zone climate control, power-adjustable and heated/massaging front seats (on premium trims), and rear window blinds for passenger comfort.<p>Driver Aids: Available driver assistance systems include a 360° camera, front and rear parking sensors, driver attention alert, and blind spot assist.
