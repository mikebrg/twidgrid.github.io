The Zenvo ST1 is a high-performance sports car manufactured by Danish company Zenvo Automotive. It was the company's first model and was manufactured almost entirely by hand by a small team of workers using a CNC router.<p>Specifications<p>The ST1 is powered by a twincharged 7,011 cc (7.0 L; 427.8 cu in) General Motors LS7 V8 engine that generates 1,104 PS (1,089 bhp; 812 kW) at 6,900 rpm and 1,430 N⋅m (1,055 lb⋅ft) of torque at 4,500 rpm. According to The Motor Report, the car set a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) time of 3.0 seconds, with 0–200 km/h (124 mph) taking 8.9 seconds, and a top speed of 375 km/h (233 mph).<p>The ST1 is hand made along with the use of a high-performance, five-axis CNC router. It comes equipped with keyless entry, satellite navigation, telescopic steering wheel adjustment, and electrically adjustable leather racing seats.<p>The car has a list price of €660,000. The price for registering the car in Denmark is around DKK 16 million (€2,143,952) as a result of the country's high registration taxes; however, Zenvo is aiming only at the export markets. Production was limited to 15 cars.<p>Design<p>Zenvo claims the ST1 is entirely a result of Danish design by Christian Brandt and Jesper Hermann. The carbon fibre body was made in Germany and many components such as gauges, gas tank, ABS brakes, traction control and airbags come from American or German made cars.
