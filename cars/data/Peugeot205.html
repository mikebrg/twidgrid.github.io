The Peugeot 205 is an iconic supermini car produced from 1983 to 1999, widely celebrated for saving the Peugeot brand, its legendary GTI hot hatch variant, and for its agile handling and robust engineering. <p>Overview<p>The 205 was a massive commercial success, with over 5.2 million units sold, and won "Car of the Decade" by CAR Magazine in 1990. It was offered in 3 and 5-door hatchback body styles, as well as a Pininfarina-designed 2-door convertible (CTI/CJ) and a panel van. The car was praised for its sophisticated fully independent suspension system (MacPherson struts at the front, trailing arms with torsion bars at the rear), which provided an excellent blend of ride comfort and handling. <p>Performance Models<p>The 205 gained iconic status through its performance models, particularly the 205 GTi, still considered one of the greatest hot hatches of all time. <p>205 GTi: Launched in 1984 with a 1.6-litre engine (105-115 bhp), and a 1.9-litre version (128 bhp, later 120 bhp with catalytic converter) in 1986. The 1.6 is famed for being revvy and eager, while the 1.9 offers more torque and all-around disc brakes.<p>205 Rallye: A stripped-down, cost-effective alternative for motorsport, featuring a high-revving 1.3-litre engine with twin Weber carburetors and a very low weight of around 794 kg (1,750 lbs).<p>205 T16: A rare, mid-engine, four-wheel-drive Group B rally homologation special, of which only 200 road-going examples were built, sharing little with the standard 205 except its looks. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>The 205's mechanicals are generally robust, but its age means that certain areas are prone to wear and tear. <p>Rear Suspension: The trailing arm bearings in the rear axle are a known weak point. Owners should check for excessive negative camber (wheels tilting inwards at the bottom) or creaking sounds, as this indicates the need for a potentially costly rebuild or replacement of the entire axle.<p>Rust: While better than some contemporaries, corrosion can be an issue on older models, particularly around the wheel arches, sills, boot floor, and the area behind the fuel tank.<p>Engine & Mechanics: Petrol engines with high mileage may burn oil (worn valve stem seals are a common cause), while proper maintenance, including regular timing belt changes, is essential for longevity. Gearbox synchromesh on second and third gear can also wear out.<p>Interior: Interior plastics, especially on early models, were basic and can rattle. Driver's seat bolsters are often worn on GTi models.
