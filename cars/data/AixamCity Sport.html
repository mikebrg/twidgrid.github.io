Aixam City Sport

The Aixam City Sport was produced from 2010 to 2016, marking a full generation of this sporty microcar before being succeeded by updated models in the City lineup.
<p>
The City Sport was part of Aixam’s push to modernize the image of the microcar, moving it away from being seen purely as a practical “no-license car” and instead giving it a youthful, stylish personality. Compared to the standard Aixam City, the Sport trim added sharper styling cues such as more aggressive bumpers, sporty alloy wheels, and bolder color options. It was primarily designed for urban driving, compact in size but with a distinct aesthetic that made it stand out on European city streets.
<p>
Under the hood, the Aixam City Sport carried the same reliable small-displacement diesel engines (primarily Kubota 479cc two-cylinder units) as its siblings, keeping within the regulations that allowed 16-year-olds in many European countries to drive it without a full car license. Performance was capped at around 45 km/h (28 mph) to comply with laws governing quadricycles, but the “Sport” was more about the look and feel than raw speed. Inside, Aixam gave the trim a sportier vibe as well, with better upholstery, optional infotainment, and a cabin that leaned more towards comfort and style than pure utility.
<p>
All in all, the Aixam City Sport struck a balance between regulatory practicality and youthful appeal. It offered a gateway car for younger drivers or those unable to obtain a full license, but without sacrificing personality. Its lifespan from 2010 to 2016 was relatively short, but it helped redefine Aixam’s branding toward lifestyle-focused microcars rather than purely functional vehicles.
