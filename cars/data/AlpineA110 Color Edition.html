The A110 Color Edition was launched in March 2020 alongside the A110 Légende GT, and comes in Sunflower Yellow, a contemporary reimagining of the Jaune Tournesol color that was popular on Alpine models in the 60s and 70s. It also includes 18-inch GT wheels, translucent taillights and new headlight inserts.
