Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport Grand Prix

The Chiron Pur Sport Grand Prix was announced in December 2021. It is the first project of Bugatti's new ‘Sur Mesure’ (meaning tailored in French) customization program, so it is a one-off car. In 1931, Louis Chiron won the French Grand Prix at Montlhéry in his Type 51 – an enhanced version of the legendary Type 35 – together with Achille Varzi. The number 32 was displayed in bold letters on their racing car and is now hand painted on the doors of the Chiron Pur Sport 'Grand Prix'. "EB" logo patterns are also hand painted in red on the front and rear fenders. Inside, the car features black leather and red Alcantara, embroidered "EB" pattern on the door panels and black anodized aluminum trim panels with silver logos.
