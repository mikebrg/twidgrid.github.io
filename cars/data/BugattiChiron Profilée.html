Bugatti Chiron Profilée
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The Chiron Profilée is a one-off special introduced in December 2022. It is based on the Chiron Pur Sport, but features a new aerodynamic profile characterized by wider air dams and a bigger grille up front, a redesigned front splitter, and a relatively small rear wing with a hollow middle section. Bugatti also made changes to the steering and suspension systems, and it gave the seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission 15% shorter gear ratios. It is the fastest-accelerating car of the Chiron range with a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) of 2.3 seconds. 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) takes 5.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) takes 12.4 seconds. It has a top speed of 380 km/h (236 mph). It's finished in silver (Argent Atlantique) and the bottom part of the car features bare carbon fiber that's tinted in blue (Bleu Royal Carbon). It is the first Chiron fitted with woven leather on the dashboard, the center console and the door panels.<p>Bugatti had planned to build 30 units, but as the production of its pre-series vehicle started, all 500 Chiron slots were already assigned. The project was cancelled and the car never entered production thus only one example was built and it is fully street-legal in European markets. On the 1 February 2023, the Profilée was sold at auction by RM Sotheby's for €9,792,500, with a percentage of the proceeds going to benefit charitable causes. At the time of its sale, it was believed to be the last street-legal W16-powered car Bugatti sold, as the Chiron and the Mistral were already sold-out.
