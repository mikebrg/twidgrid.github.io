The Citroën Jumpy (badged Citroën Dispatch in some countries) is a light commercial van jointly developed by FCA Italy and PSA Group (currently Stellantis), and previously manufactured by Sevel, a joint venture between the two companies formed in 1994. The Jumpy is also sold as the Peugeot Expert, Fiat Scudo, Opel Vivaro, and Toyota ProAce.<p>All three models were facelifted in March 2004 before being replaced by new, second-generation models in 2007. The redesigned models again shared the same design and engineering, with subtle trim changes between each brand. The second generation received a small facelift in February 2012 and from July 2013, Toyota began sales of a rebadged version called the Toyota Proace.<p>In December 2015, Citroën, Peugeot and Toyota unveiled their new generation of these vehicles in people carrying-specifications called the Citroën SpaceTourer and Peugeot Traveller, with Toyota retaining the Proace name. The commercial versions premiered later, retaining the Peugeot Expert and Citroën Jumpy names.<p>In May 2016, the Fiat Scudo was replaced by a second generation of the Fiat Talento, a rebadged Renault Trafic. From the 2019 model year, the Jumpy has been rebadged as the Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro, replacing the previous Vivaro model, which, from 2001 to 2019, had been based on the Renault Trafic. From the 2022 model year, the Jumpy has also been rebadged as the Fiat Scudo, to replace the previous Talento model, which, from 2016 to 2020, had been based on the Renault Trafic.
