The Zenvo TSR-S is a road-legal version of the track-focused Zenvo TSR. Unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, the TSR-S features numerous upgrades and design changes compared to the previous TS1 models and sits in-between the road-going, grand touring TS1 GT and the race-focused, track only TSR.<p>On the exterior of the car, the TSR-S has been redesigned with a larger front grille and large integrated splitter and diffuser. The carbon-fiber wing on the rear of the car is able to rotate with two degrees of freedom, allowing for air braking and corner stabilization. The interior of the car is driver focused as the TSR as standard, however many features of the TS1 GT can be optioned into the car like a sound system and climate control. Weight savings on the TSR-S sum to 85 kg (187 lb) over the TS1 GT, bringing the total weight of the car down to 1,495 kg (3,296 lb).<p>The powertrain of the TSR-S has also been updated, and the 5.8-liter twin-supercharged V8 now rated at 878 kW (1,194 PS; 1,177 hp) at 8,500 rpm. The manufacturer claims that this performance increase allows the TSR-S to accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.8 seconds, and from 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 6.8 seconds. The TSR-S maintains the 325 km/h (202 mph) top speed of the TSR.
