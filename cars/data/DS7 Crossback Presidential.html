On his inauguration on 14 May 2017, the elected president Emmanuel Macron chose the DS 7 Crossback as his presidential car. This was the first time a president used an SUV model as part of an inauguration ceremony. It was only used once for this occasion and was later exhibited in the showroom DS World Paris.<p>This specific version (lent seven months before the model is sold in France, scheduled for January 2018) is in an ink blue color and has a custom-made, uncovered roof. French flags and logos "RF" (for "République Française" (or "[the] French Republic" in French)) appear in various places, the interiors a black leather, and a "lacquer canvas" (a fabric coated with lacquer) has been specially made by the Maury workshop.<p>On the occasion of the European Heritage Days on 16 and 17 September 2017, the DS 7 Crossback Présidentiel was exhibited in the courtyard of the Palais de l'Elysée.
