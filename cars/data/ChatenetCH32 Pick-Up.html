The Chatenet CH32 Pick-Up was introduced in December 2012 and remained in production until 2018. It was part of Chatenet's CH32 lineup, which also included the CH32 Break, a more passenger-focused variant. The Pick-Up version, however, stood out with its open cargo bed, catering to those who needed a compact vehicle with a touch of utility. <p> Design & Features<p>The CH32 Pick-Up retained the quirky, retro-modern styling of the CH32 series. Its design was reminiscent of larger vehicles, giving it a more substantial presence on the road. Despite its small size—measuring just over 3 meters in length—it offered a practical cargo area, making it a favorite among those needing a license-free vehicle with utility.<p>Engine & Performance<p>Under the hood, the CH32 Pick-Up was powered by a 0.5L diesel engine, delivering around 5.4 hp. This engine choice was in line with European regulations for microcars, ensuring that the vehicle could be driven without a full driver's license in many countries. The diesel engine provided a balance between performance and efficiency, suitable for urban commuting and light-duty tasks.<p> Legacy & Availability<p>While the CH32 Pick-Up is no longer in production, its legacy lives on among microcar enthusiasts. Owners and collectors can find parts and accessories through various online retailers specializing in microcar components. The vehicle's compact size and unique design continue to make it a standout in the world of quadricycles.<p> Final Thoughts<p>The Chatenet CH32 Pick-Up is a testament to French ingenuity in the microcar segment. It combined the charm of a classic design with the practicality of a utility vehicle, all while adhering to the unique regulations of the European microcar market. For those seeking a blend of style, utility, and a dash of French flair, the CH32 Pick-Up remains a noteworthy option.
