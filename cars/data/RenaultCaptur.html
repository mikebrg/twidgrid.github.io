The Renault Captur is a series of subcompact crossover SUVs manufactured by the French automaker Renault. The production version of the first one, based on the B platform, made its debut at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show and started to be marketed in France during April 2013. The Captur Concept was first shown at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show.<p>Under the "same skin with different specification" strategy adopted by Renault, the Captur was made in a larger version based on the low-cost B0 platform shared with the Duster. It uses the similar styling with the first-generation Captur but with an extended wheelbase, greater ground clearance and all-wheel-drive drivetrain. Referred internally as the "Captur Global Access", the vehicle was produced in Russia, Brazil and India.<p>The second generation model was introduced in 2019. It has a larger sister model marketed as the Renault Symbioz since 2024.
