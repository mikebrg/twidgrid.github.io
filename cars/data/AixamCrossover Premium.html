The Aixam Crossover Premium was produced from 2012 to 2015, with the electric version, the e-Crossover Premium, introduced later.
<p>
The Aixam Crossover Premium made its debut in 2012 as a compact, licence-free microcar, designed to be driven without a full driving licence in certain European countries. This model featured a 523cc diesel engine, delivering 20.4 horsepower, and was equipped with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). It boasted a top speed of 98 km/h and a fuel tank capacity of 16 litres. The Crossover Premium was characterized by its SUV-inspired design, offering higher ground clearance and a raised driving position, which contributed to its rugged appeal. It also included features like LED front and rear lights, disc brakes at the front, and drum brakes at the rear. The vehicle's compact dimensions made it suitable for urban environments, while its design catered to those seeking a more adventurous aesthetic in a licence-free car.
