The Peugeot 201 is a classic car produced by Peugeot between 1929 and 1937 that holds two significant places in automotive history: it was the first car to use Peugeot's iconic three-digit naming scheme with a central zero, and the "201 C" variant was the first mass-produced car in the world to feature independent front suspension. <p>Overview and Historical Significance<p>Presented at the 1929 Paris Motor Show amidst the Wall Street crash, the 201 was marketed as an inexpensive and robust vehicle, which helped Peugeot to weather the ensuing economic depression that bankrupted many competitors. Its robust, simple, and reliable mechanics made it a commercial success, with over 142,000 units produced in total. <p>Noted Features and Innovations<p>Independent Front Suspension: The 201 C model, launched in 1931, offered an optional independent front suspension system that dramatically improved road holding and reduced steering wheel vibration, a major innovation for mass-produced cars at the time.<p>Naming Convention: The 201 was the first car from Peugeot to use the 'x0y' naming convention, where the central '0' became the brand's signature and was legally protected against other manufacturers (famously causing Porsche to rename its 901 model to 911).<p>Durability and Economy: Its simple and robust mechanics made it highly reliable and economical to run, which was crucial during the economic crisis of the 1930s.<p>Body Versatility: A wide range of body types were produced, including commercial versions like flatbed trucks and vans, catering to a variety of private and business needs.
