The Microcar Pratic Luxe was a commercial, or utility-focused, variant of the company's Virgo microcar. A four-wheeled, two-seat vehicle, it featured a longer rear section designed for carrying cargo instead of passengers. <p>Key facts about the Microcar Pratic Luxe:<p>A utility model: The "Pratic" badge indicated its commercial nature, with the extended bodywork offering more storage than a standard microcar.<p>Based on the Virgo: The Pratic Luxe was part of the Virgo III series, which was in production during the early 2000s.<p>Engine and performance: Like most microcars, the Pratic Luxe was equipped with a small diesel engine and an automatic transmission. This made it a license-exempt quadricycle in some countries.<p>Successors: Following Microcar's merger with Ligier in 2008, the Pratic was eventually replaced by newer utility models in their combined lineup, like the Ligier X-Pro.
