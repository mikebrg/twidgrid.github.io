The Peugeot 405 is a highly successful large family car produced in Europe from 1987 to 1997, which was voted European Car of the Year in 1988. It is celebrated for its excellent ride and handling, Pininfarina styling, and robust diesel engines. <p>Overview and Driving Experience<p>The 405 shared its floorpan and engines with the Citroën BX but featured conventional suspension (except for 4x4 models which had self-regulating hydraulic rear axles). It was praised for its balance of performance and comfort, making it a popular choice in France and Britain. The high-performance Mi16 model, with a 1.9-litre 16-valve engine, gained an iconic status as a great driver's car. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>The 405 is generally considered a dependable car, particularly models built after the 1992 facelift, which addressed many early build quality issues. <p>Build Quality: Early Phase 1 cars suffered from poor build quality, rattles, and misaligned interior trim, which were significantly improved in the Phase 2 facelift models.<p>Engine Maintenance: The timing belt on all engines is a critical maintenance item that must be changed on schedule to prevent severe engine damage. The 1.9L diesel engine is especially robust and can cover high mileages reliably if maintained properly.<p>Electrical Faults: Issues with the electrical system, such as faulty power window mechanisms and central locking, can occur on older models.<p>Suspension: While the handling is a strong point, owners should check for wear in suspension components, particularly on heavily used examples. <p>The 405 also had significant success in motorsport, with the mid-engine, four-wheel-drive 405 Turbo 16 GR winning the Paris-Dakar Rally in 1989 and 1990.
