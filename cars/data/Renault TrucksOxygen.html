Oxygen project<p>Changes are occurring in urban freight transport, whether in terms of emission regulations, restricted access, or the proliferation of modes of mobility sharing the public space.<p>For reasons of massification, vehicles with a tonnage of 3.5 tonnes will remain at the core of urban distribution.<p>Renault Trucks and GEODIS have partnered to design an 16t electric heavy duty test truck dedicated to urban logistics, meeting the requirements of city-center freight transport at a comparable cost to that of a diesel vehicle.<p>
A second version of 26t equipped with a refrigerated box, designed in partnership with supermarket chain Jumbo, SVZ, and the support of Renault Trucks Dutch subsidiary, started testing in October 2024 in Amsterdam. <p>An electric truck adapted to urban logistics<p>OxygenThis vehicle -project name: Oxygen- makes it possible to integrate all the requirements and functions of city-center delivery: elimination of nuisances such as pollution and noise, and improvement of active and passive safety in order to better manage co-existence with all road users. The truck has a lowered cab, giving the driver an excellent direct view. A large windscreen and multiple cameras instead of mirrors provide a 360° view. On the passenger side, a sliding side door avoids the risks associated with opening a conventional door. The driver is able to get out of the truck on either side, left or right. Climbing in and out of the truck is made easier by a much lower access height than on a standard delivery truck.<p>For perfect conservation of transported goods, the second prototype vehicle is equipped with an isothermal body with directed temperature, suitable for transporting 25 supermarket trolleys.<p>Optimal ergonomics and easier access to the cargo space are sought after with a view to improving loading and unloading operations in an urban environment. Connected tools enable drivers to optimize their delivery operations and their routes. <p>To ensure that this vehicle blends into the urban landscape perfectly and with a view to enhancing both the comfort and the self-esteem of the driver, Renault Trucks designers have completely redesigned both the exterior lines of the truck and the interior of the cab.<p>The truck is powered by a 100% electric drive train, which is silent and does not emit any CO2 during operation.
