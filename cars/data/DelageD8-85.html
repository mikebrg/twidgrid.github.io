The same year saw the launch of the D8-85 and the D8-105. The D8-85 was the less extreme in terms of ultimate performance, offered with a choice between a 3,378 mm (133.0 in) and a 3,578 mm (140.9 in) chassis. The engine displacement is 3,570 cc (217.9 cu in) in this version producing, as indicated by the name, a maximum output of 85 hp (63 kW) at 4,000 rpm. On The D8-105 the engine size was the same, but the unit was modified to produce 105 hp (77 kW), while the car sat on a shortened 3,296 mm (129.8 in) chassis.<p>In April 1935 the manufacturer's financial difficulties culminated in the closure of Delage plant at Courbevoie, as a result of which the D8-85 and Delage D8-105 were taken out of production.
