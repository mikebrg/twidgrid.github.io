The Aixam Minauto Access is one of the entry-level models in the Aixam microcar lineup. Aixam is a French manufacturer known for building quadricycles (often called “microcars” or “light cars”), which can be driven in many European countries with just a moped license (AM license) starting at age 16—or even 14 in some places.<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the Minauto Access:<br>
🔹 Category: Light quadricycle (L6e)<br>
🔹 Top Speed: 45 km/h (restricted by law for this category)<br>
🔹 Engine: Usually a small Kubota 2-cylinder diesel engine, around 400–500 cc, producing about 6–8 HP<br>
🔹 Transmission: Automatic (CVT belt-driven)<br>
🔹 Seating: 2 seats<br>
🔹 Dimensions: Compact and city-friendly, about 2.8 m long (roughly half the footprint of a normal car)<br>
🔹 Fuel Efficiency: Very economical, often around 3 liters per 100 km<br>
🔹 Safety: Basic, but built with reinforced passenger cells and complies with EU quadricycle standards (though not as safe as a full-size car)<br>
🔹 Target Use: Urban commuting, short-distance travel, or as a safer alternative to scooters/mopeds.<p>The Access trim is the most basic, no-frills version—think: manual windows, simple interior, fewer electronic gadgets. It’s designed to keep the price as low as possible while still being road-legal.
