The Peugeot 304 is a small family car produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot from 1969 to 1980, known for its Pininfarina-designed exterior, independent suspension, and front-wheel drive. <p>Overview and History<p>The Peugeot 304 was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in September 1969 to fill a gap in the mid-size car market. It shared its central section and many mechanical components with the smaller Peugeot 204 but featured a distinct front end inspired by the larger Peugeot 504 and a longer boot. The car was considered modern for its time, featuring a transversely mounted all-alloy engine, fully independent suspension, and front disc brakes. Over its production run, approximately 1,178,423 units were produced across various body styles. <p>Noted Reviews and Features<p>Robust and Comfortable Reviewers note the 304 was a robust and comfortable vehicle, offering a superior ride and handling compared to some competitors of its era.<p>Practicality The estate (Break) version was considered very practical, with a low loading area and fold-down seats. The car's front-wheel drive configuration also allowed for enhanced cabin space.<p>Performance The "S" versions, available for the coupé and cabriolet models, featured a twin-choke carburetor and increased power to 75 bhp, providing more satisfactory performance.<p>Potential Issues Like many cars from the 1970s, corrosion is a significant concern for potential buyers of classic models. Sourcing specific spare parts, especially for unique body panels like the cabriolet's rear lights, can also be challenging.<p>Design The car's design, particularly the cabriolet, is noted for offering an affordable entry into stylish Pininfarina-designed classic car ownership.
