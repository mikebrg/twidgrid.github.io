The Peugeot 202 is a supermini produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot between 1938 and 1949, known for its distinctive headlights integrated behind the front grille and independent front suspension. <p>Overview and History<p>Launched in March 1938, the 202 was a modern car for its time, featuring independent front suspension and overhead valves, at a time when rivals were still using older technology. Production was interrupted by World War II from 1942, with only a very brief run of 20 cars in early 1945 before restarting properly in mid-1946. The car was a commercial success and was eventually replaced by the Peugeot 203 in 1949, with over 104,000 units built in total. <p>Noted Features<p>Distinctive Headlights The 202 was instantly recognizable due to its headlights being placed close together and protected behind the front grille, a styling cue shared with larger models like the Peugeot 402.<p>Independent Front Suspension It featured independent front suspension as standard across the range, which improved road handling and ride comfort for its class at the time.<p>Suicide Doors Both front and rear doors were "suicide doors" (hinged at the rear) for ease of ingress and egress.<p>Wartime Production Challenges Post-war "hatch" (estate) versions used extensive timber in their bodies, a response to the severe shortage of sheet steel in France at the time.<p>Affordability and Reliability The car was considered easy to drive, gave reliable performance, and was economical to run, which contributed to its popularity in various markets.
