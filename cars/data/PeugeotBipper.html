The Peugeot Bipper was a compact commercial van produced from 2008 to 2017, designed for urban use and sharing its platform with the Citroën Nemo and Fiat Fiorino. It was known for its maneuverability and practicality in tight city spaces. <p>Key Features and Specifications<p>The Bipper was designed as a "betwixt-and-between-sized" van, slotting in below models like the Peugeot Partner. <p>Design: The van had a compact overall length of just under 3.9 meters, which contributed to an excellent turning circle of around 9.95 meters (kerb-to-kerb), making it highly agile for city driving.<p>Cargo Capacity: It offered 2.5 cubic meters of load volume, which could be extended to 2.8 cubic meters with the optional fold-flat passenger seat (Multi-Flex seat system). The maximum payload capacity was up to 610 kg.<p>Interior: The cabin offered a functional interior with features such as power steering, ABS, and driver/passenger airbags as standard, though more advanced safety features like electronic stability control (ESP) were often optional or absent in earlier models. 
Engine Options<p>The Bipper came predominantly with small, efficient petrol and diesel engines, designed for economical running costs. <p>1.4L Petrol: Produced around 74 hp and was capable of around 42 mpg.<p>1.4L HDi Diesel: Offered around 68-70 hp and was known for its better fuel efficiency (up to 63 mpg).<p>1.3L HDi Diesel: A later addition producing around 75 hp (or 79 hp in later models), which replaced the 1.4L diesel in some markets and could be fitted with a semi-automatic "2-tronic" transmission option. <p>All versions of the Bipper came with a 5-speed manual or semi-automatic gearbox, as a fully automatic option was not available. The Bipper Tepee, a five-seat MPV passenger version, was also available but was quietly dropped from the lineup around 2014.
