Peugeot 406
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The Peugeot 406 is a highly regarded large family car produced from 1995 to 2004 (in Europe), known for its handsome design (especially the Pininfarina-designed Coupé), excellent ride comfort, and robust diesel engines. It was a significant success for Peugeot, particularly in the fleet market. <p>Overview<p>The 406 was developed on the same platform as the Citroën Xantia but without the complex hydropneumatic suspension. Its handling and ride quality were widely praised, with a sophisticated independent multi-link rear suspension that offered both comfort and stability. The car was available in three body styles: a 4-door saloon, a 5-door estate (SW), and a stylish 2-door coupé. <p>Common Problems & Reliability<p>The 406 is generally considered a reliable car, particularly with the 2.0 HDi diesel engine, which can last for very high mileages if well-maintained. However, there are a few known weaknesses. <p>Electrical Issues: Electrical gremlins are common, with reported issues including central locking faults (especially the boot lock), faulty indicator stalks, and dead pixels on dashboard displays.<p>Suspension and Brakes: The front suspension components, such as anti-roll bar links, may require replacement due to wear. The rear brakes on some models are also prone to rusting, and the parking brake is not always effective.<p>Engine Maintenance:<p>Timing Belt: Regular timing belt changes are crucial for all engines; failure to replace it at the recommended interval (around every 5 years or 60,000 miles) can cause significant engine damage.<p>Oil Leaks: V6 engines are robust but can suffer from oil leaks.<p>DPF Issues: On 2.2L HDi diesel models, the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) system requires regular maintenance and correct fluid levels to function properly. <p>Many owners praise the car for its durability, noting that regular maintenance and addressing wear-and-tear items are key to its longevity.
