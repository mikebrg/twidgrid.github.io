The Renault Rafale is a mid-size crossover SUV that has been produced by the French manufacturer Renault as a coupe SUV since 2024. Built upon the Renault–Nissan CMF-CD platform, it shares about 75 percent of its parts and design features with the SUV Espace and Austral models.<p>Codenamed 'DHN', the vehicle is the second coupe SUV produced by the brand after the Arkana compact crossover. In Renault's lineup, the vehicle is positioned between the Arkana and the slightly larger Espace VI.<p>The Rafale is named after the C.460 Rafale monoplane introduced in 1934 by the Caudron-Renault aviation company, although the name was also used more recently on the Dassault Rafale fighter jet.<p>Overview<p>The vehicle is 4,710 mm (185 in) long, meaning it belongs to the British D-segment size segmentation, and has full hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains.<p>The Rafale received a new plug-in hybrid powertrain with 300 hp (220 kW) and all-wheel drive by installing an electric motor at the rear. Despite being smaller than the Espace, the Rafale is still considered the flagship for the brand. The Renault Rafale E-Tech full hybrid version has an autonomy of 1,100 km with a full tank of petrol, according to WLTP data.
