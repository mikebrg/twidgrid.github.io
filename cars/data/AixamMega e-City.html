Developed in collaboration with NICE, the electric Mega e-City was first shown at the 2006 British International Motor Show, and has been produced by Aixam since March 2007. Until the end of 2008, it was built exclusively for the London market as a right-hand drive vehicle. The maximum speed is 64 km/h (40 mph), with a range of 60–80 km (37–50 mi).<p>Since the end of 2010, the Mega e-City has also been available with a lithium-ion battery. Having the same top speed, the range was increased to 100 km (62 mi). The price of the model in Germany fell from €16,000 gross to less than €15,000 between 2010 and 2020.
