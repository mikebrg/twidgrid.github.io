The PGO Cévennes is a neo-retro, two-seater sports car produced by the independent French manufacturer PGO Automobiles. It was first unveiled in 2005 and shares its classic design inspiration, specifically the Porsche 356 Speedster, with the earlier PGO Speedster II model. <p>Key Features and Specifications<p>Design: The Cévennes features a distinctive vintage appearance with flowing fenders, round headlights, and a low beltline. Its body panels are made of a composite material on a rigid, light tubular chassis. Each vehicle is handcrafted and highly customizable, ensuring a degree of exclusivity, with no two cars being exactly alike in some cases.<p>Engine and Performance:<p>Early models: Initially equipped with a mid-mounted 2.0-liter, 140 hp Peugeot engine (sourced from the Peugeot 206 GTI), paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox.<p>Later models: From 2012, PGO signed an agreement with BMW to use a more powerful 1.6-liter turbocharged engine (as found in the Mini Cooper S), producing 184 hp and 240 Nm of torque.<p>Driving Experience: The car is known for a raw, engaging driving experience, with rear-wheel drive, a low curb weight of approximately 998 kg (2,200 lbs), and simple, predictable handling. The unassisted steering provides direct feedback from the road.<p>Dimensions:<p>Length: 3,700 mm (145.7 in)<p>Width: 1,735 mm (68.3 in)<p>Height: 1,320 mm (52.0 in) <p>Unique Aspects<p>The name "Cévennes" honors the Cévennes mountain range in the south of France, the region where PGO is headquartered.<p>The car was notably featured in the video game World Racing 2.
A natural gas-powered turbo roadster version was also explored by the company in 2008.
