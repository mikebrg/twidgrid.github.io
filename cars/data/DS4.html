DS 4
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The DS 4 (2015) is a subcompact hatchback, and it is the second model in the luxury DS sub-brand created by Citroën, now an independent brand. Starting in 2021, it is currently in its second generation, which is based on an all-new EMP2 platform shared with the Opel Astra L and Peugeot 308 III. As of 2023, it is currently slotted above the DS 3 and below the DS 7 Crossback.<p>Overview<p>Based upon the Citroën C4 II, the first generation was officially launched internationally in March 2011, but already on sale in some countries by the end of 2010. It features raised suspension to resemble a compact SUV and repositioned door handles to give it a coupé like silhouette.<p>The rear windows are fixed, and do not slide down or open outwards.<p>At launch, the petrol engines that powered the DS 4 were all a product of a collaboration between PSA and BMW, all being 1,598 cc four-cylinder, 16 valve units. The base VTi 120 was normally aspirated and put out 120 PS (88 kW). As its name implies it came with variable valve timing. The next engine up was the THP 155, essentially a turbocharged version of the VTi.<p>It put out 156 PS (115 kW) thanks to a twin-scroll turbocharger and dual overhead cams, and used a six-speed manual transmission. The most powerful engine option was the THP 200, a variation of the THP 155, but with an output of 200 PS (147 kW). Citroën initially offered two diesel engines in the DS 4 – the HDi 110, a 1,560 cc four-cylinder that put out 112 PS (82 kW) and the four-cylinder HDi 160 also found in the sedan Citroën C5. There was also a 2.0-litre diesel displacing 1,997 cc and producing 163 PS (120 kW).<p>The engine line up differs significantly. The DS 4 is available with Start&Stop technology and Citroën says that the battery has been optimised to withstand up to 600,000 starting cycles. The boot is 385 L (13.6 cu ft) and expand to 1,021 L (36.1 cu ft) with the back seats folded down. The DS 4's styling has been very well received by the international press.<p>It was elected Most Beautiful Car of the Year at the International Automobile Festival, beating BMW’s new F10 5 Series and Honda's new CR-Z hybrid car. German magazine Auto Bild, and its partner magazines throughout Europe, have given it first prize for design, in its category in the contest Design Award. Production of the DS 4 ended in April 2018.
