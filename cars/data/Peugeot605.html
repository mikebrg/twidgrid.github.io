The Peugeot 605 is an executive saloon car produced between 1989 and 1999, noted for its elegant Pininfarina styling, luxurious ride, and powerful V6 engine options. However, its early models suffered from significant reliability problems that damaged its reputation. <p>Overview and Design<p>The 605 was designed to replace both the larger, unsuccessful Peugeot 604 and the top-spec versions of the Peugeot 505. It shared its platform with the Citroën XM but featured conventional suspension rather than the complex hydropneumatic system. <p>Styling: Designed by Pininfarina, the 605 had elegant styling, though critics often noted its strong resemblance to the smaller, cheaper Peugeot 405, which harmed its executive image in the marketplace.<p>Facelift: In 1995, an extensive "Phase 2" facelift introduced side airbags, improved interior quality, and addressed many of the initial reliability issues, though sales remained low. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>Early models of the 605 were notorious for poor build quality and reliability issues, particularly with the electrical systems, leading to a large-scale recall campaign to fix these problems. Cars built after 1992 generally have better build quality. <p>Electrical Faults: Numerous issues with the electrical systems, including central locking, power windows, and dashboard warnings, were a major problem for early models.<p>Engine Maintenance:<p>Timing Belt: On 2.0-litre petrol engines, the cam-belt must be replaced every 30,000 miles to prevent engine failure.<p>V6 Oil Leaks: The V6 engines are robust if maintained, but can suffer from oil leaks and require careful attention to oil quality.<p>Turbocharger Issues: The 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine provided good performance but proved unreliable.<p>Suspension: The car's precise handling was a strong point, but owners should be mindful of potential wear in front suspension components over time. <p>Despite its initial reputation issues, well-maintained later models are considered a bargain on the used market due to low resale values and excellent driving dynamics.
