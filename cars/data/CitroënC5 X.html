Citroën C5 X
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The Citroën C5 X is a mid-size crossover SUV produced by the French brand Citroën since June 2021.<p>The nameplate was previously used on the Citroën C5. Dubbed the C5 X, the "X" meaning crossover, it is styled as a station wagon, with increased ground clearance. It is a large crossover SUV, for buyers who want a sport utility vehicle, or a wagon. The vehicle is intended to be a combination of an SUV, sedan and estate. It is available as a plug-in hybrid with shared technology from the Peugeot 508. The C5 X is marketed as the Dongfeng Citroën Versailles C5 X in China, resurrecting the Versailles name once used for the Ford Versailles.<p>The C5 X follows the design of the 2016 CXperience concept. The C5 X is approximately 50 mm (2.0 in) shorter, about 13 mm (0.5 in) taller, and about 130 mm (5.1 in) less wide than the CXperience. The C5 X PHEV comes in 4 driving modes, Electric, Hybrid, Comfort and Sport, with 39 miles (63 km) of fully electric driving. The C5 X is based on the EMP2 V3, shared with the similar Peugeot 408.<p>In May 2025, the C5 X was discontinued in the United Kingdom with right-hand drive production ended in the same month, therefore the C5 Aircross became the flagship model in the market. However, sales of the C5 X continued in other European countries. Thierry Koskas, CEO of Citroën explained, "I don't think Citroën is very present in the market with the C5 X. It's a tiny segment, because as soon as you go into the D-segment, you compete with premium brands, and the sales of generalist brands are small. So I'm not sure we'll do anything in this segment in the future."
