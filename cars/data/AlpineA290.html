An Alpine-branded high-performance variant uses the more powerful traction motor from the Mégane E-Tech, which is rated at 160 kW (210 hp). The Alpine variant retains the front-motor, front-wheel drive layout of the Renault 5 E-Tech, but the track is wider for a sportier look.<p>On 9 May 2023, Alpine unveiled the A290_β, a concept car that previews the production model. However, before the official debut, two photos of the model were accidentally leaked online.<p>The production A290 was unveiled on June 13, 2024 before the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The design is identical to the concept. the base GT Premium is powered by a 130 kW (180 hp) electric motor, while the more powerful GTS has a 160 kW (220 hp) electric motor from the Mégane E-Tech that accelerates to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.4 seconds. The battery has a capacity of 52 kWh and a range of 380 km (236 mi).
