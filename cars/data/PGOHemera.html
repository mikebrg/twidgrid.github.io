" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The PGO Hemera is a unique, two-door, two-seater sports car best described as a mid-engined "shooting brake" or a mix of a coupé and a break. It is produced by the French independent car manufacturer PGO Automobiles and was launched in 2008 at the Paris Motor Show, with production starting in 2009. <p>Key Features<p>Design: The Hemera has a distinctive "retro-futuristic" aesthetic, combining classic lines inspired by the Porsche 356 with modern elements like a unique rear glass bubble.<p>Body and Chassis: The car uses a multi-tubular frame with a composite, hand-molded bodyshell to keep the weight down (around 980-1012 kg or 2,160-2,233 lbs).<p>Engine Options: The Hemera has been equipped with two primary engines over its production run:<p>Early Models (pre-2012): A mid-mounted 2.0-liter, 140 hp Peugeot four-cylinder engine.<p>Later Models (post-2012): An official switch to a BMW Group-sourced 1.6-liter turbocharged engine, producing 184 hp and a maximum torque of 240 Nm.<p>Performance: With the BMW engine, the Hemera can reach a maximum speed of 225 km/h (140 mph). Its light weight allows it to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in under 7 seconds.<p>Driving Experience: It offers a purist driving experience with rear-wheel drive, manual transmission, and unassisted steering, which is often described as a "go-kart feeling".<p>Practicality: The shooting brake design provides increased trunk capacity (240 dm³) and enhanced interior luminosity compared to PGO's other models, making it more practical for daily use or long weekends. <p>Manufacturing<p>Like other PGO models, the Hemera is largely handcrafted at the company's headquarters in Alès, France, allowing for a high degree of customization. Each car is built to order, contributing to its exclusivity and status as a niche sports car.
