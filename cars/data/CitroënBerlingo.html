The Citroën Berlingo and Peugeot Partner are a range of vans produced since 1996 and marketed under the Citroën and Peugeot marque. They are sold as light commercial vehicles or as a passenger multi-purpose-vehicle variant with rear seats and windows. They were initially a product of the French PSA Group, which later became part of the multinational Stellantis conglomerate. The third generation has also been sold under the Opel and Vauxhall Motors marques as the Combo, by Toyota as the Proace City from 2019, and by Fiat as the Doblò from 2022.<p>The panel vans are available in passenger versions named the Berlingo Multispace and Partner Combi, Partner Tepee, and Peugeot Rifter for the third generation. In Italy, the first generation of the Partner was known as the Peugeot Rancher. They were initially based on the Citroën ZX/Peugeot 306 estate floorpan and mechanicals.<p>With their rectangular, box-like cargo space and aerodynamic front, conceptually they can arguably be considered the descendants of the Citroën 2CV panel van (AK400). The new 2018 Citroën Berlingo and Peugeot Partner/Rifter also share their design with the new Vauxhall/Opel Combo, following GM's sale of Opel to PSA.<p>Both the Berlingo and Partner have been produced in CNG and electric versions and with four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines.
