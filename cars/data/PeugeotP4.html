The Peugeot P4 is an unarmoured off-road military vehicle used by the French armed forces, which is a licensed derivative of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class (Geländewagen) but equipped with a Peugeot engine and transmission. <p>Overview and Design<p>Developed to replace the aging Hotchkiss M201 (Jeep), the P4 project was a collaboration between Peugeot and Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes supplied the chassis, axles, and some running gear from the G-Class, while Peugeot installed its own engines (initially from the Peugeot 504 and 604), transmissions, and electrical systems. The bodywork, initially designed by Panhard, was built by Peugeot, and the final assembly took place at the Sochaux factory. Visually, the P4 is often distinguished from the G-Wagen by its unique front grille and rectangular headlights. <p>Reliability and Common Issues<p>The P4 is known for being a robust, highly capable off-road vehicle. Given its military application and age, reliability concerns primarily relate to standard wear and tear and the logistics of parts availability. <p>Robustness: Its simple, utilitarian design makes it fundamentally durable and easy to repair in the field.<p>Performance: Early diesel versions were often considered underpowered, particularly at higher road speeds (topping out at about 45 mph).<p>Rust: Corrosion can be an issue on older, exposed components.<p>Parts: While many mechanical parts are shared with civilian Peugeot models (504/604) or the Mercedes G-Wagen chassis, specific military components or body panels may be harder to source. <p>The P4 served the French military for nearly 40 years before being phased out and replaced by newer vehicles like the Panhard PVP and ACMAT VT4.
