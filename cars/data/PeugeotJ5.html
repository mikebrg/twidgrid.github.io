Peugeot J5
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The Peugeot J5 is a light commercial vehicle produced from 1981 to 1993, which was developed as part of a joint venture between PSA Group and Fiat. It is mechanically and visually almost identical to its sister models: the Fiat Ducato and Citroën C25. <p>Overview<p>The J5 succeeded the Peugeot J7 and was primarily a front-wheel drive van that was popular in France but less so in other European markets compared to the Fiat Ducato. In the UK, it was also sold as the Talbot Express. A notable aspect of the J5 was its popularity as a chassis platform for motorhome conversions due to its robust design and front-wheel drive layout. In 1991, the J5 received a facelift (Series 2) with an updated front grille and headlights before being replaced by the Peugeot Boxer in 1994. <p>Common Problems and Reliability<p>Given the J5's age, most surviving vehicles are classics or used motorhomes, and their condition heavily depends on past maintenance.<p>Engine Performance: Turbo wastegate sticking and fuel delivery issues can cause uneven engine performance in the diesel models.
Rust: Corrosion is a major concern on vehicles from this era and should be thoroughly checked on sills, arches, and the underbody.<p>General Wear and Tear: Suspension, brakes, and other mechanical parts will have significant wear due to age and potential heavy use. 
The J5's basic and robust mechanics are a plus for classic vehicle owners, as they are relatively simple to maintain and repair compared to modern vans.
