Aixam City Pack
" class="crimage"><p class="mttext">
The Aixam City Pack has been in production since 2008, continuing through the 2010s and into the 2020s with several updates and facelifts, making it one of the most recognizable models in Aixam’s microcar lineup. Designed as a quadricycle rather than a traditional car, it remains available in various trims, including the Pack version, which is positioned as an affordable and practical entry-level model.
<p>
The Aixam City Pack was created for drivers who wanted urban mobility without the complexity or expense of a full-size car. It is small, lightweight, and can be driven in many European countries without a full car license—appealing particularly to young drivers and those looking for an easy-to-park commuter. Despite its compact size, the Pack variant provides essential features like heating, comfortable seating, and straightforward controls. Over the years, Aixam has refined the model with safety improvements, better noise insulation, and styling updates to keep pace with modern city vehicles.

Under the hood, the Aixam City Pack is powered by a small diesel or electric motor, depending on the version, keeping fuel consumption and running costs impressively low. The diesel option is usually based on a Kubota engine, known for durability, while the electric version caters to eco-conscious urban drivers. With its limited top speed (generally around 45 km/h), it is not designed for highways but is perfectly suited for narrow city streets. In essence, the City Pack combines efficiency and affordability with a touch of European practicality, making it a long-standing choice in the microcar segment.
