The Renault Trafic (pronounced as "traffic") is a light commercial van produced by the French automaker Renault since 1980. It has also been marketed as the Fiat Talento, the Nissan NV300, the Nissan Primastar and the Mitsubishi Express. Until 2019, it was also sold as the Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro (briefly sold as the Opel/Vauxhall Arena earlier) by Opel and its associated company Vauxhall. From early 2022 onwards, the van is also marketed by Renault Trucks as the Renault Trucks Trafic.<p>Previous versions of the Renault Trafic have been sold under Inokom, Chevrolet and Tata badges.<p>The second generation Vauxhall/Opel Vivaro was produced in GM Manufacturing Luton and in Sandouville Renault Factory plant starting in 2014. However, following the sale of Opel/Vauxhall from General Motors to Groupe PSA in 2017, which later went into car manufacturing merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2021 as Stellantis, the Trafic-based Vivaro went out of production in 2019, and was replaced by the next generation Vivaro based on the Citroën Jumpy EMP2 Platform for the 2020 model year.
