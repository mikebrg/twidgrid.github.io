The Aixam D-Truck Drop Side has been in production since 2014 and continues to be available in both thermal and electric versions.<p>
Aixam, a French manufacturer based in Aix-les-Bains, has a long history of producing microcars and light utility vehicles. The D-Truck series was introduced in 2014 as part of their Aixam Pro range, designed specifically for professional use without the need for a driving license in certain European countries. The D-Truck Drop Side model features a versatile flatbed with drop-down sides, making it ideal for transporting various goods in urban and rural settings. Over the years, the D-Truck has been offered in both diesel and electric variants, catering to different environmental and regulatory preferences. The electric version, known as the e-Truck Drop Side, provides a zero-emission alternative for businesses looking to reduce their carbon footprint. Aixam continues to innovate in the microcar segment, offering a range of vehicles that combine practicality with compliance to European quadricycle regulations.
