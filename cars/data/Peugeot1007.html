The Peugeot 1007 is a unique small mini MPV produced from 2004 to 2009, primarily known for its distinctive remote-controlled electric sliding doors and a user-swappable interior trim concept called "Caméléo". <p>Key Features and Design<p>The 1007 was a bold, unconventional model for Peugeot, designed by the Pininfarina studio to offer exceptional accessibility and urban maneuverability. <p>Electric Sliding Doors: The signature "Open Sesame" twin power sliding doors are the car's most notable feature. They slide backward along the car's body without protruding outwards, which is ideal for parking in narrow spaces and provides excellent access to the cabin.<p>Interior Modularity: The interior was highly flexible. The two individual rear seats could slide fore and aft or fold flat, and the front passenger seat could also fold down to create a large loading space. A unique "Caméléo" system allowed owners to easily change interior trim pieces (seat pads, door card inserts, etc.) using optional kits, personalizing the car's look.<p>Safety: Despite its compact size, the 1007 was strong on safety, featuring seven airbags as standard and achieving a high five-star Euro NCAP rating for adult occupant protection. <p>Market Reception and Reliability<p>The 1007 was an commercial failure due to its high price point (comparable to larger, more conventional superminis) and polarizing design. <p>Reliability: While the car's mechanicals were largely standard PSA components with reasonable reliability, the complex electric sliding doors are a potential and costly point of failure if problems arise outside of warranty coverage. Owners should be mindful of potential issues with the 2-Tronic semi-automatic gearbox and general electrical gremlins.
